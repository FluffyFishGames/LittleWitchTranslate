This lousy train! The only thing this boring hunk of metal does is chug on and on! I can’t believe something like this is the essence of magic.
If we’re talking about something truly mysterious, then that shining tree outside the window is a better fit than this train. In fact, a true witch wouldn’t pass by on an opportunity to take a closer look at such a marvel.
Though it looks like a normal forest on the outside, there could be more to it than meets the eye.
Mom always said those who act can find hidden secrets!
I’ll shrivel up out of boredom like dried old cheese, if I go back to the train now. I need to find just one more oddity.
An Extractor... That shattered bottle reminds me of the concoctions class.
We were making a Bomb Potion in secret, but Scaredy-Cat Will was so nervous he put in the wrong ingredient. The mixture boiled too quickly and...
The glass bottle shattered... I had to write 10 pages of apologies as punishment. It was horrible.
I don’t know who the witch that used to live here was, but thanks to her, I should be able to make {BadGrassPotion_Name} without much trouble.
I’m not particularly fond of cleaning myself, but this person seems to have a phobia of cleaning. I left my tables clean, at the very least.
I guess this is what they mean by out of the frying pan, into the fire? But I can’t give up now.
I didn’t even flinch in the face of a Black Forest Tree Giant! Something like giant prickly vines are a piece of cake for me.
Spiderwebs of this size must mean the spider is enormous.
Jenny did always like large, fluffy, and strange creatures.
I should write her a letter after I discover this Spider, uh, King.
But first, I should rescue them.
To think the Bomb Potion that destroyed the Principal’s Secret Door isn’t enough!
Just what sort of prickly vine is this?
A piece of it fell off, so I should take it back for research.
Nothing is impossible in my life!
It really does feel like I’m on an adventure. My butt would’ve exploded from boredom if I stayed on the train. But now, I’m all alone! No Jenny, no Will, just me! I’m solving the problems in this forest all on my own.
I should be able to reach the village once I get rid of the prickly vines. Let’s do this!
Come to think of it, I’ve never set foot on a village outside Lucerine Ortu.
Mom used to sneak outside during her years in the School for Witches. I couldn’t dare do the same, when getting caught would mean expulsion.
I wonder what this place is like? I hope it’s as fun as Clock Alley.
Prickly vines... prickly vines... endless prickly vines.
At this point this village should be called Prickly Vine Village instead of Wisteria. But, how did it manage to grow specifically targetting houses?
Divine punishment? A monster? Curse? In any case, I’m gonna get to the bottom of this.
Writing letters is so much fun. It makes me happy when I use the Blue Star Quill Dad gave me as a gift for getting accepted into the School, dipping it in the Night Sea Ink Mom gave me.
So, I wrote Kyla a letter in the middle of the night. I can’t wait to meet her.
How long has it been since I’ve waited in anticipation for someone? I’d always see my friends at school, and Mom and Dad were at home during school holidays, so I’ve never really gone through this experience before.
I wonder what Kyla is like? What does she look like? How is she going to build her home?
I need to uncover the truth behind the strange dream.
Let’s get rid of the prickly vines in the village, so that people can return and restore the village.
Just being able to breathe fire would make it easier to control the flames under the cauldron. Plus, I’d be able to explore dark caves as much as I want.
Even when I’m cold, just opening my mouth would solve that problem!
I must be the only witch who’s about to learn how to breathe fire straight from a dragon’s mouth.
I wonder what’s inside a dragon’s bag...? He even said it was an “important ingredient.”
Maybe it’s special salt that can only be mined in the deepest recesses of the Earth,
or maybe it’s a herb from a forest void of light...
I should ask what it is later.
A curse that forces you to do nothing but praise nature... There really are all kinds of curses out there. Must be frustrating if you’re forced to speak only specific phrases.
I’d hate to be forced to speak nothing praises for Virgil. (I should make sure Virgil doesn’t read this.)
I’ve been wondering ever since I came to this village... but isn’t it too dark out at night?
Enite and Rubrum could easily get hurt wandering out at night. I should figure out how they’re handling this issue and see if I can do something about it.
It sucks to trip and fall just because you can’t see a thing in front of you.
Scrumptious pie, filled with sweet fruit. It was always a treat to have pie. Dad’s golden pie was always delicious, but I wonder what Enite’s pie tastes like?
In any case, I love the smell of pie baking away.
Rubrum sure does love playing with sand. To think he’d take the shovel with him. But isn’t Kyla’s shovel too big to play with...? Or maybe he took it to search for treasure? I always used to fool around with Mom’s broom when I was a kid. I guess that’s just how it is?
I should find Rosie’s bait.
If someone asks me what the worst moment in my life was,
I’d say the train to Highlion without a doubt.
Argh, I really don’t want to go on the train...
Everything would be so much more fun without trains.

Something tells me that my recent dreams are pretty important.
Repairing the Witch’s House
I need to repair the place, but who do I speak to for help?
Liza
That’s the name of the witch who used to live in the Witch’s house.
Ritoring
A curious creature in the shape of an acorn
The Village Streetlamp
How should I fix the village streetlamp
Twinkle-Twinkle Juice
A sweet-tasting potion that makes your body glow if you drink it.
Night Light
A peculiar lamp with a silver glow. Supposedly helps with sleep.
Behold, these boots!
Made by a master of the craft, these boots are as comfortable and fashionable as can be! No need to string up the laces one by one! With these touch-and-go boots, you can take them off at a moments notice before getting off the train once it stops!
The moon... Something, Something
I wonder if there’s anyone who can decipher these ancient witch runes written in the note?
I should ask where I can find sacred water.
A Better Roaster
I should replace the Roaster with a better one.
A Better Extractor
I should replace the Extractor with a better one.
Upon closer inspection, the prickly vines stem from the ground. This is a clue that points towards the core of the prickly vines I need to destroy in order to get rid of the prickly vines! I don’t know where it is, but I promise I’ll find it.
Then, ta-da, these prickly vines will no longer destroy houses!
If I knew this was going to happen, I should’ve asked for another train ticket in case of theft. To think I’d need it this desperately after complaining about how stupid it looks. I guess I should’ve taken better care of it when I had the chance.
It served me well, but... In any case, I need to think of another way.
I should deliver 1 Nutrition Potion, Candy 00, and Candy 02 to Diane.
I should deliver 3 Stubborn Weed Extermination Potions and 2 Curse Dispel Candies to Diane.
I should deliver 1 Nutrition Potion and Candy 01 to Diane.
I should deliver 1 Fast Pace Potion and 2 Healing Candies to Diane.
I should deliver 5 Healing Candies to Aurea.
I should deliver 5 Curse Dispel Candies to Aurea.
I should deliver 5 Candy 01 to Aurea.
I should deliver 5 Candy 02 to Aurea.
Let’s do what a witch does to frogs that appear only in spooky places
I should deliver 1 yellow Twinkle-Twinkle Juice, silver Twinkle-Twinkle Juice, and pink Twinkle-Twinkle Juice to Diane.
The Source of the Curse
Who cursed Arden?
Let’s repair the fountain
Arden can’t seem to sleep that well because of those dreams he keeps having. He thinks it’s because of a curse, but did he really do something deserving of a curse? I heard the person who casts the curse becomes affected as well.
But why now? Who would hate Arden this much?
Since Arden can’t recall anything, I should look for clues hidden within objects. From what I’ve heard, objects can hold the memories forgotten by a person. There’s even witches who can trace the memories using those objects. Maybe I could give it a try?
A special potion often used in festivals. Crafting one is prohibited for anyone enrolled at the School for Witches.
Old things hold memories. Teacher Olivia used to say this all the time. She said there are things in the world that aren't made by witches, but are still imbued with magical powers. I wonder if Arden’s light is like that. This is my first time hearing about a night light.
As he used to be a villager, what was Roy like?
Build Roy’s House
Build a house for Roy!
Build Houses for the Villagers
Deliver Diane’s Potion
{count} Luna Coin(s)
Currency commonly used in the witch society. A moon is embossed on the silver coins.
Potion class was a required course at the School for Witches. Crafting was fun, but using set recipes was boring. I wasn't allowed to do even that after I did things my own way and caused a small explosion.
{count} Gold Coins
Delivering Aurea’s Potions
The standard currency.
Withered Beansprout
A beansprout that normally grows tall and strong.
A crazy bird. It makes a terrible noise that no sane person can endure.

I wonder where the [em1]carrot[/em1] was?
You're still thinking about that?
We found everything except the [em1]carrot[/em1].
I think it's good that we never found the [em1]carrot[/em1].
There was something off about that "legendary" [em1]carrot soup recipe[/em1].
I just realized we never checked the men's restroom.
Yes, there are just some [em1]lines you don't cross[/em1].
We searched the whole school save for that place, but we never found the [em1]carrot[/em1]. 
That means the carrot was in the [em1]<wave>men's restroom</wave>[/em1]!
A carrot in the men's restroom? What an odd sense of humor...
I should write Jenny a letter asking her to look through the men's restroom.
Can't you ask Will instead? It's the men's restroom after all...
Nope. That coward finds it, he’ll take it to the teacher bawling, like before.
Keep in mind that if it weren't for Will, you'd be in jail right now.
Or six feet under.
... Ugh. I'm so bored!
It's a flashback. Flashbacks are supposed to be boring.
I see why no one else wants to ride this god-awful train. It's boring enough to drive anyone insane.
Hey. A ticket for this train costs 500 pies,
And it’s stop? The Witch's House in [em1]Highlion[/em1], where all roads lead to.
You're [em1]second place[/em1] at the School for Witches.
Whatever! I don't care about any of that!
How am I [em1]second place[/em1] anyway? I even sneaked into the forbidden room twice!
Three times.
I even looked through the forbidden books in the hidden library in the school basement!
I still remember that horned rabbit that was as big as a house.
No wonder Will started crying.
So how did I manage [em1]second place[/em1]!?
I simply didn't want to lose!
Cut it out and sit quietly. This is a [em1]train only for those who want to succeed[/em1].
The witch's house might be dark and damp, but it's only three years of your life.
Fine, fine. Enough with the lecture.
As a matter of fact, I’m disturbed with the thought of taking off my [em1]shoes[/em1] when I get off the train.
Shoes? For what?
I wonder what kind of trouble you’ll get into when we arrive.
I won't! I won't fool around the moment I get there!
I didn’t know you had self-awareness.
Don't you know about the [em1]terrible city of rules[/em1] that is Highlion?
The first thing to do is to take your shoes off as soon as you get off the train.
I heard that Jenny’s older sister was wearing [em1]strappy boots[/em1] when she first arrived at Highlion.
This is my first time hearing something like that.
See! Mom bought me new shoes as well!
Didn't Aria just mean to encourage you?
No, dad also did say that comfortable boots would be better.
That’s strange.
It’s true. I’ll also ask other people if you don't believe me.
So she almost couldn't get off because she had to unstrap them completely.
Any interesting stories?
I’m ready to hear and also ready to tell!
Huh?
Hello, Ellie.
Goodbye.
I'm worried about which tea leaf to brew.
I'm making fresh flower tea.
I don't have any tea brewed yet.
Thanks for helping me get home!
That’s nothing special.
Oh, [em1]grandma[/em1] wants to meet you.
Grandma?
Yes, she’s the [em1]village chief[/em1]!
They say not in these times, but she’s still the village chief. She’s right behind me.
Okay. I’ll go.
Oh, Ellie!
Okay, take care.
But it really looks like no one is in the village.
Yes, many of them left after the [em1]prickly vines[/em1] have grown.
Now we only have Uncle Arden’s and my house.
I see. You must be bored.
No. It's okay because grandma and Uncle Arden are here! There are also lots of fun things in the forest.
She's the village chief!?
Welcome.
Take care.
Do you have something to say?
I’m listening. Tell me.
What's going on?
Do you have a favorite fruit?
I've stayed in this village for a long time.
Was Rubrum caught in a web in the grove across the lake?
It's a comfortable wind.
Apple
Peach
Strawberry
Grape
I like apples.
I like peaches.
I like strawberries.
I like grapes.
I see. Is there anything you can't eat or don't like?
Ginger
Cinnamon
Raisin
I also can't eat ginger.
I also can't eat cinnamon.
I also don’t like raisins.
I don't have any particular dislikes other than fish.
I don't like fish.
Don’t worry. I don’t put fish in my pie.
Among the pie materials...
I see. Come visit me anytime if you're hungry.
It’s not that great but I’ll bake you some pie.
Wow, really? I’ll definitely come.
I was born and grew up here till now, and will probably die here.
This is a good village for me, in the past and even now.
I think so too.
Thank you.
For you, Rubrum, Arden and everyone else,
I hope this village becomes a good place.
It will be. Let's all make it so together.
Let’s do that.
Yes, that’s right. He was caught in a spiderweb.
Did you hear that from Rubrum?
I didn’t ask Rubrum.
Then how did you know that was the place?
Strangely enough, he resembles me.
What?
I also used to get lost there easily when I was little.
[em1]Liza[/em1] used to rescue me when I got caught in the spiderweb and take me home.
[em1]Liza[/em1]? Who is [em1]Liza[/em1]?
[em1]Liza[/em1] is a witch who was originally at the witch house you’re staying in.
When I was little, she used to help me when I got into trouble.
Just like you and Rubrum now.
Talk to Rubrum if you need some tea.
I don’t have any that I’m selling.
Welcome, witch.
You’ve done a great job with helping my grandchild. Thank you.
No, I’m the one who received help.
Many witches look different from their age...
Alright, I shall speak comfortably, Ellie. Welcome to Wisteria.
I'm [em1]Enite[/em1], chief of this village.
What happened in this village? What are all those prickly vines?
I’m Ellie, an apprentice witch.
Did you take a look around the village?
Yes, I saw the houses covered with prickly vines.
They didn’t look like ordinary prickly vines.
At first, they were saying things like [em1]god’s punishment[/em1], [em1]monster[/em1] or [em1]witch’s curse[/em1]...
One day three years ago...
Even so, people who had no place to live anymore left the village inevitably.
What happened to the villagers?
Wipe off your drool, Ellie. It's a serious story.
Nobody was hurt.
Now only [em1]Arden[/em1] and I are left to protect the village.
Don’t worry now. I’ll help you.
Thank you so much for saying that. 
All the houses have been ruined already and everyone left. 
Ellie, you should also leave now. It's better to go to the place you were originally planning to go.
I'm not forcing you. You can stay in the village for as long as you want.
But...
But it’s too late now.
It's not a village but two old people with a lot of regrets are protecting the [em1]ruins[/em1].
But leave when the train comes. This place is... not a village anymore.
Why did the prickly vines started growing all of a sudden?
There were lots of rumors, but no one actually knew why.
They started growing all of a sudden without any explanation.
<shake>That can’t happen!</shake>
Highlion is boring as hell!
Virgil! Bad word!
Ellie...
There are no more [em1]people[/em1] here. Even if the prickly vines are removed, nothing remains.
This is still a [em1]village[/em1]! Even the people who had left would want to come back!
Even if the prickly vines disappear, why would they come back to a village like this?
Everyone would want to come back!
But Ellie... People left and time has passed.
No. They would definitely want to come back!
It's a wonderful village that you have been cultivating all your life, [em1]Enite[/em1].
Those prickly vines started to grow all of a sudden and destroyed the houses one by one.
Actually, there were already prickly vines growing in the village.
I'll remove the prickly vines and bring the villagers back together.
Even though both the village chief and the village are in bad shape.
The [em1]White Prickly Vine[/em1] at the village entrance was the one originally growing in the village.
But I only saw the prickly vines that started growing for the first time three years ago.
The prickly vines grew fast for a plant, but not fast enough to hurt anyone.
You can speak comfortably.
Yeah... You’re right but...
I don't think those driven out by the prickly vines will ever want to come back to these ruins...
I can't let the village get taken away by these [em1]weird prickly vines[/em1].
Phew...Let's go to sleep for today and talk again tomorrow.
Okay.
Don’t scold [em1]Rubrum[/em1] too much.
Yeah, okay. Get some rest.
You too, Enite!
I’m...
You look tired too. Rubrum looks like he needs to rest as well.
Welcome. Have you eaten?
Did you meet Arden?
Come to think of it, I guess I didn't say thank you properly.
Have you eaten?
Yes, I'm eating well.
You look so skinny. You should eat more.
But I tend to eat alot.
It is best to eat well and sleep well at your age.
Come here anytime if you’re hungry.
Here, take one of these. Eat it if you’re hungry.
Wow, thank you.
Yes, I've met him.
Although he looks like that, he has a good heart.
Seemed like a good person.
Then I guess he likes you. That’s a relief.
Stop by the Arden Restaurant often.
Even though he looks like that, he gets lonely easily.
If you visit him, he’ll like it even if he doesn’t show it.
If you go there, have some food also.
Thank you so much for helping Rubrum.
Don't mention it. I've heard enough thanks already.
Ellie. It would have been really hard if you didn't come.
Rubrum, me and even this village...
Thanks again.
The weather is so nice today.
I baked some pie.
You're so thin.
It's the apple pie that you said you liked.
It's the peach pie that you said you liked.
It's the strawberry pie that you said you liked.
It's the grape pie that you said you liked.
I removed the ginger.
I removed the cinnamon.
I removed the raisin.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you. I’ll enjoy it.
Of course. I eat three meals a day.
You’re still so thin.
Oh, but I’m really strong.
Make sure you eat well and get plenty of sleep, Ellie.
I baked some more pie. Take them.
Thank you. I’ll enjoy them again.
I’ll think about it. Let’s talk again [em1]tomorrow[/em1].
Yes, see you tomorrow!
I don't know about that.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
It’s my first time hearing it.
I’m not sure.
Check special greetings
The main menu? It’s the stew I’m boiling for more than a hundred years.
There is no special recipe for cooking.
I always have plenty of pepper ready.
I’m running it all the time although it’s quiet.
The restaurant has no special meaning. I’m running it out of habit.
Shall I cook some stew today?
Nothing has changed today.
It’s the pipe I always use.
It seems as if I’ll remember something if I do this.
Feels refreshing to see it.
Say it.
I guess you’re not busy.
Do you like pepper?
A moderate amount is good.
Yeah, it's good in moderation.
That’s moderate?
I had a dream.
What kind of dream?
I don’t remember.
Then why did you tell me?
Because I remembered that I don’t remember.
What do you mean by that?
I also have some work to do.
No, I mean the restaurant.
Are there no customers here?
Well, because no one is here.
I guess it's not delicious enough to bring in people from other villages.
No matter how much pepper you put in, it's never too much.
So, it's the right amount no matter how much you put in.
I mean that’s a wrong standard.
The soup is good today.
I’m free but...
Are you hungry?
Come again if you’re hungry.
I’m not open for business now.
I don't know about that story.
I’ve never heard of it.
Are you talking about Liza? She was a very nice person.
There's probably no one here who didn’t receive help from Liza.
But she disappeared all of a sudden.
Was there something different about her before she disappeared?
No, nothing in particular.
Since she was often immersed in her research, I thought she was being her usual self.
Do you know what kind of work she was doing at home by any chance?
She usually didn't talk about herself.
So I’m not sure about that.
Oh, maybe Bintz might know. Bintz used to talk with Liza often.
I see. Thanks for letting me know.
Who's Bintz?
Bintz is one of the villagers who had left when the village became like this.
Bintz is a painter who used to lived in the house at the upper part of the village.
Do you happen to remember anything about the witch who was here before?
She healed me when I was sick.
I had a really bad headache but got better right away after taking the medicine.
Is there anything else?
Um...
Oh, the person at the bakery always made deliveries to the witch's house.
I guess she liked bread.
The bread from the bakery is delicious! I like it too.
You will be able to eat it again.
I'm disappointed that they moved. I want to eat it again.
Oh...
It really is an abandoned witch's house.
Taking that into consideration, it looks okay.
Although it’s not that clean.
Since the witch’s house is managed on her own.
It doesn't seem to be in a very good condition considering how dirty it is.
But the bed looks fine.
I guess I can just sleep here.
Um, well, since the witch's house is a [em1]public institution[/em1].
And it's better than sleeping outside.
It’s okay to sleep one night or so.
What's with that face? You slept on a nice, fluffy bed.
Yes but...
I dreamt that I was sleeping on the train.
All that effort not to sleep on the train, only to dream of just that.
You should have just slept on the train.
No, that's not it.
I slept very well, actually.
I can almost hear the [em1]sound of the train[/em1], though.
Wait... Isn't that actually the [em1]sound of the train[/em1]?
What? Really?
Is it taking off already?
Let's hurry!
What is that thing?
It's called the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "Gaga_Name"))][/em1]. They say it's a bit insane.
Quiet. I don't want to hear it.
It's your fault for oversleeping. Don't blame the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "Gaga_Name"))][/em1].
Fine. Whatever. Just be quiet.
I wonder where the witch is? The one who lived here.
This place is probably very old.
She must be eating and living well somewhere in Lucerine Ortu.
She really messed up the house.
It reminds me of your room.
My room was cleaner than this.
That might be so from a dust standpoint.
It’s also messy [em1]in front of the desk[/em1] over there, Ellie.
Stop bossing me around like a teacher.
I finally managed to get out of school!
All done cleaning!
There's some dust over there, Ellie.
Don't leave food behind, Ellie.
I told you not to go inside the principal's office, Ellie.
You should have listened.
Oh, this is a [em1]witch elevator[/em1]!
That's why you have to listen to the teachers.
Let's hurry up and go down.
What if there's a scary monster?
You think so? Oh, I'm so excited!
Wow. Look at this, Virgil.
This must be the [em1]Dispensary[/em1]. You can probably make [em1]potions[/em1] with the proper [em1]tools[/em1].
We should definitely do some [em1]cleaning[/em1].
Wow... [em1]Cleaning[/em1] again...
I know what this is! It's an [em1]Extractor[/em1]! 
We used it sooooo many times at school. It was a slightly smaller one though.
It would be hard to use. Look at the [em1]glass bottle[/em1] underneath.
Oh, that's true. It's broken.
I'll need a friendly toad at least.
I’ll need to get a [em1]glass bottle[/em1] first in order to use this.
Let's look for one.
By the way, there’s nothing normal here.
It would be rather strange to be normal when it’s dirty like this.
Still, the pot is fine.
You need to at least fix the extractor in order to make potions.
Alright. Let’s go to the [em1]village[/em1] first.
A [em1]Roaster[/em1]? Ugh, I hate this thing.
You have to put in the ingredients and just wait. It's awful.
Can't you simply put them in and do something else while you're waiting?
It seems to be in bad condition however.
Really? Oh, yes. There is no handle for winding the spring.
Where would I get a roaster handle?
Still, the cauldron is fine.
And there should be something when you get to the village.
Yeah, the village comes first.
I don’t need the roaster since it is not needed for the basic recipes.
Wow, this is a pretty good cauldron.
I think it was made by the Blue Lightning Workshop.
It's style is very traditional.
I've only ever used the cheap cauldrons at school. Finally, I get to use a good one!
Do you remember how to use one?
Of course!
Expertly processed [em1]ingredients[/em1], the exact [em1]heat intensity[/em1], and the right [em1]ladling technique[/em1].
And at last!
At last! You'll end up with a proper [em1]potion[/em1].
I actually liked Teacher Olivia.
Still, the cauldron looks fine.
You’ll be able to make a potion if you have the ingredients.
The machine tools are in bad condition though.
Since there are some discarded ingredients...
Let’s make the potion we need using them for now.
I think this is the way to the [em1]village[/em1], but the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] is in the way.
Hmm... Would [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))][/em1] work?
That's a good idea.
It's a basic [em1]recipe[/em1], and the ingredients on the floor should suffice.
Okay! Let me show you what I've got.
Let's go to the [em1]witch's house[/em1] and find a way.
The road is blocked.
Alright, I can just throw the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))] here.
The [em1]village[/em1] I saw on the [em1]sign[/em1] must be this way.
But it’s blocked by the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1].
It won’t explode either.
Hehe, I thought we’d need it, so I made one in advance!
You won’t be able to pass by unless you get rid of that thing.
It won’t last, so get in while it does, find the core, and remove it.
Good, use that.
And I can just pass by when it disappears for a while, find the nucleus and get rid of it, right?
Correct.
And also clean up.
Awesome. The [em1]<wave>Stubborn Weed Extermination Potion</wave>[/em1] is complete!
It's a potion for removing weeds.
Anyway, it's ready!
Okay. Don’t worry.
You must use it carefully since there are no more ingredients.
Let's go throw it at the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1].
Why did you make this?
Do I need a reason for making a potion?
A normal person would.
It’ll be used somewhere.
Just in case.
Just because I wanted to make it
No reason.
Just because you want to make it?
You never know. It might be useful for something.
People normally make it when they need it.
Let’s look for the village for now.
You must throw it at the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] and make sure to remove the [em1]nucleus[/em1] as well.
Because [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))] is just a [em1]temporary measure[/em1].
I got it!
Huh? This isn't a [em1]village[/em1]!
Look over there, Ellie! It’s a [em1]prickly vine[/em1] this time.
It's so huge and thick.
Oh no...
What do I do with the Extractor?
First, take a look around here.
Wow, they are really big.
Too big for the '[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))]‘, I think.
Hm... We'll have to do [em1]something else[/em1].
We'll have to stay at the witch's house for a while.
Look at this, Virgil!
It's a [em1]<wave>prickly vine fragment</wave>[/em1].
It seems to have worked a little bit.
But the vines appear to have grown back pretty fast.
We might be able to figure out exactly what these [em1]<wave>prickly vines are</wave>[/em1].
These prickly vines aren't even in the codex. How are you going to figure that out?
Let's show the fragment to someone and ask them about it.
Hm, well...
Oh, wouldn’t a person living around here know something?
Isn’t it heavy?
Really?!
Just stop talking.
Our village is just a little further from here!
But you cannot pass through now because of the prickly vines.
Let's go to the witch's house for now and find a way.
Yeah.
Great. They're stuck to the tree as expected.
Wow, there are tons of shining [em1]butterflies[/em1]!
You're going to make them all go away now, right?
I feel so bad for them all of a sudden.
It's for the tree's sake. Hurry up and sprinkle the potion!
Okay. Here goes!
I’m here. Now let’s hurry up and get rid of the annoying vines.
Did you happen to suffer somehow because of me...?
Don't worry about that.
This was my [em1]choice[/em1]. What I really wanted to do.
And this is my [em1]choice[/em1].
I have finally arrived at the [em1]village[/em1]!
Yeah, it’s a village.
What kind of village would it be? I hope a lot of fun things happen there.
There would be a lot of annoying things to take care of.
I was always expecting something like that.
Let's hurry up and go.
Uh...
It’s quite a dull sight.
Virgil...
How’s the village that you have to stay in for three years?
Do you feel like going back to Highlion again?
What the heck happened here?
What’s this [em1]evil prickly vine[/em1]?
I don't even know where to start.
I’m so excited.
Let’s find [em1]Rubrum[/em1] first.
And... Something seems strange.
It's strange for anyone to see the [em1]prickly vines growing only on houses[/em1].
No, that's not what I meant.
It feels like [em1]I've been here[/em1] before for some reason.
What kind of useless double meaning is that?
There's no way you've ever been here.
They don’t come this far for the witch school picnic.
Something [em1]feels familiar[/em1].
- Closed -
I guess it’s a restaurant.
This house looks fine.
Can you do business in a place like this?
A restaurant in a village like this...
Open: 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM
It’s not open for business now.
Here are the business hours.
Aren't they too short?
That’s up to the owner.
I wonder what he sells.
Let’s come back on time.
I hope it’s something delicious.
What are you trying to do?
Enite is right. It requires a lot of imagination to call this place a village.
It’s still a [em1]village[/em1] even if there are no houses!
Yeah, but it’s not a village if there are no [em1]people[/em1].
The people will come back.
How can you be so sure? This is your [em1]first time[/em1] in this village.
If you’re just being ridiculous...
No, I definitely heard it! The villagers want to come back!
Where did you hear it? You didn’t even see a villager.
That... I don’t know. Maybe I heard it in a [em1]dream[/em1].
That's absurd.
No.
It's absurd.
<shake>No, it isn’t!!</shake>
Who would fix the house even if the prickly vines are removed?
There are two old people and one child remaining.
You’re right, Virgil.
You need a [em1]carpenter[/em1] to fix the house.
I guess you should have a deep dream...
In order to meet that kind of carpenter.
Stop being sarcastic!
Yeah, I wish the carpenter could fly if possible.
It would be nice to also have about six arms.
Don't be sarcastic, Virgil!
It’s the village that Enite has lived in for all of her life.
Other people would also have loved the village as much as Enite.
You know, you also just met Enite for the [em1]first time[/em1].
I can tell even if we met for the first time. There was some kind of <shake>throbbing</shake> feeling!
The first person returning has to be a [em1]carpenter[/em1].
Did you meet the flying carpenter?
I don’t know. It seems like I did have a [em1]dream[/em1] but...
I don’t remember anything.
Are you nervous or something, since this is your first day as an apprentice witch?
Of course not.
So, are you ready to start your first day as an apprentice witch?
Do you know what to do?
Let me ask what Enite thinks first.
Although she will naturally approve, it will start from the moment she approves.
We’ll check out the [em1]carpenter’s house[/em1] and try to [em1]get rid of the prickly vines[/em1].
Remember that we don’t have any [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))][/em1] left.
It will work out somehow.
Let’s go to [em1]Enite[/em1] first.
When it first appeared, I tried very hard to get rid of it.
I tried an axe and also set it on fire, but it was useless.
No matter how I made the scar, it healed quickly.
That resembles the [em1]White Prickly Vine[/em1].
Isn’t that right? But the White Prickly Vine disappeared completely when there was a [em1]full moon[/em1].
And these vines didn’t disappear even when there was a full moon.
It's as strong as the White Prickly Vine, but doesn't disappear in the moonlight... That’s strange.
We thought so too.
No, it's okay. It was helpful enough.
I mean it is the providence of nature that if there are strong places, there are also [em1]weak places[/em1].
This is all I know. I'm sorry I couldn't be of much help.
Well... I don’t have anything else to tell you.
Try asking other people as well.
I need the potion to remove this.
I found it! It’s the prickly vine nucleus.
But it’s covered with something... What’s that?
A gigantic bird cage?
Bird cage is a tool to lock up something.
It’s a tool to lock up birds. I know that much.
Now it looks like it is being used to protect the prickly vine nucleus.
Hmm, what if I use the potion without removing the bird cage?
It's not a normal bird cage. We must remove it.
Look! The pattern on the floor is the same color as the chalk I got from solving the puzzle earlier.
They must have hidden the key to the bird cage there.
Good. Then I guess we can open it right away.
Let’s draw the pattern again and open the bird cage.
Use [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonTear_Name"))][/em1]?
Hello, Ellie!
Goodbye!
This is Diane who brings happiness.
Do you have any questions?
My goal is to get off work on time.
How long has it been since you graduated from the witch school?
I have not yet graduated.
I’m just an apprentice now.
Ah, right.
I was confused after seeing only graduated witches.
Then you have started the apprenticeship just recently?
Yes, that’s right.
But the master witch is on the hat and you’re wearing it. I guess you became friends quickly.
<shake>S... Sure.</shake> I’m a very sociable person. Haha...
It looks nice.
I like it because it’s peaceful here.
It makes me want to just come here.
Do you go to other witch's houses?
Hmm, I think I normally go to three or four places a day.
Wow, it must be hard for you.
It must be hard for you.
Other witch's houses are battlefields.
You must be fast and accurate in handling the orders that are rushing in.
Does this village happen to have any bakeries?
Bakery? Not yet.
Not yet? 
You’re amazing.
It’s nothing special.
But why a bakery?
It is my hobby to eat unique desserts in various villages.
I was looking forward to the desserts of this village but now I'm disappointed.
There was probably a bakery in the village originally.
I’ll let you know if they build a bakery again.
Thank you. Please let me know.
Oh, I didn’t tell you.
The village was destroyed by the prickly vines and the people have left.
Oh, I see.
That’s why I’m removing the prickly vines and fixing the village.
It’s a nice day.
I’m Diane Greenwind.
I'm currently working for the Witches' Catalogue Department of the Witch Administration.
What does the Witch Administration do?
We manage and distribute the finances and produce of the witch society. 
The witch's houses and the Witches' Catalogue are also important functions of the Witch Administration.
Wow, that’s impressive.
It is, isn't it? The Witch Administration is the department that employs the largest number of witches.
And it's the only building where indoor flights are allowed.
Wow, being able to ride a broom inside a building really sounds fun!
Not when a flying book knocks you out while you’re blinded by a flying sandwich.
Keep up the hard work today!
It sounds like there's a lot of stuff flying.
Be wary of the flying encyclopedia. This is what we say all the time.
It’s very heavy, and if you evade the first, the second and third might hit you.
I've always been avoiding encyclopedias too.
Do books even fly at the school for witches?
No, I just don’t want to read.
Hello, apprentice witch.
See you next time.
I’m listening.
What’s going on, witch?
Thanks for helping me come back to the village.
It's only natural
Haha, I guess it was natural.
I saw a strange guy as I was cutting a tree in the forest.
It was a guy wrapped in vines, but he liked it when I removed the vines from his body.
Try helping this guy when you meet him in the forest.
Have you been to Arden's restaurant?
Yes, I've been there.
The stew there is good. You must try it.
I must eat it to feel at home.
It's the perfect weather for hammering.
Tell me if you need anything.
Arden’s stew was cooked well today.
Kyla, have you been to a city?
Yes, I stayed in a city for quite a long time.
Do you know Highlion?
Absolutely. That was the place I was going to originally.
Oh, really? I was also in Highlion for a long time before I came here.
How was Highlion?
It was easy to get materials. There were also many people looking for things.
There were many people who liked fancy decoration.
It wasn't even a garden, but there were lots of strange people asking me to hang flowers, or hang lions.
I mean on a garden shovel.
How were other things? The street... or the food?
Sorry, I wasn’t interested in things like that.
If you were just beating iron, there's no difference between here or there.
Haha, yes Virgil, you’re right.
But this place is quieter. That’s why I like it.
Enite is so sweet.
That’s right.
And Rubrum is so cute.
Yes, Rubrum is cute.
Arden is kind.
What...?
And his food is also delicious.
What? Do you really think so?
He always talks with a smile and doesn't get angry easily. He’s kind.
No, I mean the food.
I know, right? The stew there is really good.
He adds as much pepper as the other ingredients.
Is it weird? I thought it was delicious.
Is that so...
I know. It's good to be back.
Strange.
I guess it's not to your liking.
I think I have a bit more ordinary taste...
But my hammer seems to be getting lighter these days, so I'm thinking of making a heavier one.
I think it’s heavy enough.
It seems the weight has reduced after using it so often.
Do hammers also get lighter as you use it more and more?
Yeah, that's what my teacher said.
Can I try lifting the hammer?
Yeah, try lifting it.
*Grunt*
I can’t lift this.
You will be able to lift it too if you burn your flesh a little more.
Do you get stronger if you burn your flesh?
No, haha.
That's what my teacher always said. It tells us how much effort is required.
What kind of person was your teacher?
The kind of person who makes a flower by bending steel plate with bare hands.
I don't know that person, but they seem incredible.
Try summarizing what you have heard.
Enite said it has [em1]similar characteristics[/em1] as White Prickly Vine.
Rubrum said it [em1]tastes like [lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1]. Then it's probably also [em1]similar[/em1] to the[lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))].
Arden... didn't tell me anything in particular.
He said it was "[em1]someone’s malice[/em1]".
Seeing a prickly vine that can destroy and get rid of a house is enough to make you think so.
It seems that Arden thinks it is the [em1]witch’s work[/em1].
Witch's curse? In a world like today? That’s an old-fashioned way of thinking.
You wouldn’t think so if you’ve been to Lucerine Ortu.
But the witches of the old days are still alive.
Heh, let's find the culprit later. Let’s think about [em1]Kyla’s house[/em1] first for now.
In summary, the prickly vine in the village is a combination of the [em1]characteristics of several plants[/em1].
Alright. I think I asked everyone.
I think I might have seen something related to the prickly vine in the [em1]witch bookshelf[/em1] on the first floor.
Let’s also go look through the [em1]witch's house[/em1] like Arden said.
Let’s go check.
[em1]The part that removes the prickly vines[/em1]!
I can’t read anymore. I can’t finish reading this here.
Why not? Finish reading it.
Who would get rid of the prickly vines if I die?
People don’t die just because they read a book for a long time.
Hmm, I mean Aria’s daughter might die.
Look at this book. It looks like there's more than a thousand pages. Anyone would die after finishing reading this.
“The first dew of spring, a red moon butterfly, the fourth dawn of summer...”
Summarize if you’re not going to make it.
“... Mix well and put in the desired plant seeds to make a new plant."
It’s a [em1]method to combine the plant’s characteristics[/em1]!
The prickly vines in the village were [em1]combined[/em1] using this method.
It seems so.
Then now...
Wait, [em1]why is this book here[/em1]?
"[em1]Someone’s malice[/em1]"?
Naturally, that book is not uncommon.
It is a book that any [em1]witch who is interested in plants[/em1] would have.
It’s merely a [em1]possibility[/em1].
I mean [em1]both of them[/em1].
This time, you can just find a book related to the [em1]prickly vine[/em1].
For now, [em1]this one[/em1] has the priority.
Which one?
Let’s look through Kyla’s house again.
Then you’re not going to read anymore?
I think I’ll throw up if I read one more text.
I think the important details come out right after that.
What? Really? Where?
From the information I heard, it seems to be a combination of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] and [em1]White Prickly Vine[/em1].
Do you need anything?
Yes, I’m listening.
Have you tried the soup that Arden has made?
Yes, I’ve tried it.
How was it?
It was terrible.
Ask him to remove the pepper next time.
Arden wouldn't like it but quite a wonderful soup will come out.
Wow, really? I’ll definitely try it.
There are more dangers in the jungle than in the desert.
Do you like strawberries?
My love, my beautiful love.
Yes, I like them.
There is an ice strawberry that only bears fruit in the forest at the northeastern tip of the continent.
In the middle of winter, when the sunlight is strong at dawn, it forms on the tip of the tree like dew.
It’s a pinky-sized silver bead, and it fills you with refreshing sweetness.
Wow... Sounds delicious...
It’s more expensive than gold of the same weight, but it's worth it.
That’s kinda...
You’ll change your mind after eating it.
No, I don’t like strawberries that much.
But this strawberry would be different.
Why?
Because you can’t hide in the desert.
You can't cross the horizon even if you run for half a day.
In the jungle? It disappears before your eyes, even if you take only five steps.
In a deep forest, you must be careful because plants and animals become smart as well as people.
I look for you in the morning sun broken by the waves.
Oh my love, my dazzling love.
What kind of song is it?
It's a song that sailors sing.
When I sing, it’s nice to feel like I'm back in those days.
I look at you in the sails blown up to be large by the breeze.
Oh my love, my warm love.
I think I’ll be lucky today.
I’m in trouble because it's hard to get up in the morning these days.
You can see many things while working as a peddler.
Do you know when I feel the happiest while working as a peddler?
Have you ever been a sailor?
Do you have any special memories?
The old man who sold me the cursed wooden image of a monkey.
Can’t argue with that.
It’s a joke.
There was an old woman selling pottery.
She was selling two or three handcrafted potteries in the most inconspicuous part of the market.
I happened to pass by there and met the gaze of the old woman.
I still clearly remember the shape of that pottery.
It was a long, white water bottle with its spout open like a flower petal.
The mystery of the soft blue light and fish engraved around its midsection was full of life.
I had never seen such a water bottle even in Sinan Province. I fell in love with that water bottle at first sight.
I looked at the pottery placed in front of the old woman who smiled bashfully while avoiding my eyes.
I told myself I’d even buy it with every Solaris Gold Coin I had, and asked her.
How much do you think it was?
Well, you can buy 10 water bottles with 1 Solaris Gold Coin, right?
The price the old woman mentioned was 2 Equus Silver Coins.
Equus Silver Coins... Even the shoes I’m wearing are more expensive than that!
That’s what I’m saying. 
But wasn’t that so lucky?
I got upset and told the old woman off.
I told her that I’ll never buy it for less than 12 Solaris Gold Coins.
That seems to be more expensive than the house I was living in!
So what happened?
In the end, I couldn’t buy it.
What? Why not?
She said, “This child’s play cannot be sold for more than 2 Equus Silver Coins." 
She was an old woman with skillful hands, but she was terrible at appraising her own work.
Being too expensive is a problem, but it can't be too cheap either.
I never do business with people who don't know how to properly value things.
But don't you regret it?
It could have been very profitable.
Good things should be given good prices.
Wouldn't you get 1 or 2 Gold Coins?
I'm assuming it is when it's profitable?
When I see the product properly.
I feel best when I find something precious among the things laid out randomly at the country market.
Then isn’t it a big gain? You can buy it cheap and sell it.
I can’t do that. A good product must be bought at a good price.
But the other person didn’t know.
But I knew.
What if you're wrong?
Then I have only my poor eyes to blame.
Aren’t you being too nice in doing business?
It's been a really long time since I've heard that I’m nice.
Don't worry. It's a matter of my convictions rather than how nice I am.
I earn enough to get by.
Sailor? Well, yes. Why?
Since you were singing a sailor’s song...
There was even a time when I was on a ship for quite some time.
Those times were really fun.
Wow, it’s my first time meeting a sailor.
How did you end up getting on a ship? Why did you get off now?
There were some things going on.
I’ll tell you about that next time.
Tell me anytime if you want anything.
Do you think having a lot of money makes you happy?
After all, the air in this village is good.
Yes, having a lot of money makes you happy.
I don't think money and happiness have anything to do with each other.
You can buy happiness with money.
Really?
Deep in the jungle, an old man covered in odd trinkets was selling happiness.
Was one of those a wooden image of a monkey, perhaps?
...
Ellie!
Sure.
For that damn naturalist, that trash was happiness.
Oh, sure...
Some people can buy happiness with money, but some people can’t.
You'll have to pay a proper price for it, though.
I understand a little bit about praising nature.
I mean just a little bit.
So don't worry about having a lot of money or not.. You can be happy either way.
Well, I'm not familiar with that story.
I don’t have any information on that.
Did you find the bag?
Yup, here.
Ah, thanks. I needed that.
What’s in it?
Hmm, curious, are you? It’s my secret recipe.
Woah, really? What is it?
Pepper.
Pepper?
Yeah, black gold, the king of spices.
But I thought pepper is pretty cheap these days? Anyway, I don't really like pepper.
Here, have a taste. This is true cuisine.
Ugh. The taste of pepper is overwhelming!
Strange. People used to like it back in the old days.
Man, I was looking forward to this secret recipe of yours.
Just how long ago were the "old days"?
Ellie! I see you got rid of the prickly vines.
Yeah, I got rid of them.
That’s awesome!
Then I guess Kyla will be coming back!
Yup, she’ll come once I've sent the letter.
I want to see Kyla soon!
Me too!
When will Kyla be here?
She’ll be here soon.
She’ll come once I've sent the letter.
This must be the bag that [em1]Arden[/em1] was talking about.
Let’s take it.
I see a bag dropped here.
People here are sloppy.
Let’s take it for now and try to find the owner.
I also have weird dreams from time to time.
Flying in the sky, climbing trees or waterfalls...
I guess it's because you usually play a lot in the forest.
Then I fall.
I wake up everyday saying whoa.
That happens for you to grow taller.
Woah, really?
I want to become tall enough to pick leaves from tall trees.
I’m sure you will.
Right!!!
Oh, that’s a problem.
Is it a problem?
Sure it is.
A person needs a good night's sleep to be healthy. Are you eating well?
Sleep's not a problem though.
What do you mean? A good night's sleep is very important.
You must be sure to sleep eight hours a day. Especially at your age. 
That's also how you grow taller, and become smarter.
Ellie.
Why Virgil? Did you remember something?
Keep in mind that the reason you’re dumb is not because of sleep.
You’re just dumb.
Please be quiet.
If you can't sleep well, how about trying a potion?
No, it’s not that bad...
Witches easily fix problems with potions. Isn't there also a potion to cure insomnia?
Can’t argue about...
Wait, a potion? 
Let me tell you. There are also potions that make you smart.
Please be quiet. It’s not something like that.
Wouldn’t there be a potion to help you remember a dream?
I’m sure there is. Ask Diane.
Alright. That’s a good idea.
Thank you. It was helpful, Enite.
Was it? I’m glad to hear that it was helpful.
Anyway, get a good night's sleep and also eat well.
Are you saying you keep having weird dreams?
Yes... probably. Although I’m not sure, because I don’t remember...
Do you also feel some kind of disorientation when you wake up?
Like you have forgotten something important?
Yes, that’s right. It’s exactly that.
Do you know something?
No, I’m also like that.
You too, Arden?
It's not that serious, but I feel like that from time to time.
That I’m forgetting something...
I’ll let you know if I find a solution.
I’m okay.
What? But...
There would be a reason if I forgot.
Don’t worry about it.
A weird dream that I don't even know what kind of dream it is...How strange.
It’s really getting on my nerves.
It's a big problem that you can't sleep because of a dream.
No, I sleep well.
Then you don't eat well?
No, I also eat well.
What? Then you’re healthy.
But I’m still concerned.
When that happens, I tend to work more.
When I hammer, the trivial thoughts disappear and I can sleep better when I'm tired.
Hmm, is that so?
Ask Enite if you’re worried about something.
Enite often solved problems like this.
Or you can ask Arden for a drink.
I can’t drink yet.
It's no big deal.
Do you want to repair the witch's house?
Yes, the living room floor is broken.
That’s a big problem.
Hmm, if so
Did the master witch agree to it?
Of course.
She said yes.
Then if I go apply today...
A repair witch will probably come within three days.
The master witch must be present at that time. Is that ok?
Oh, now that I think about it, I actually like that broken living room floor!
It was my dream to have a house with a broken living room floor!
I...Is that so?
But you could get hurt or something. Repairing it would be...
It's okay! I’m strong!
Hmm... Alright, got it.
We have no choice if you don't want to. Tell me if you need it.
Yeah, okay!
Well done Ellie.
You refused so naturally.
I told you I’m good at acting.
Ha, right.
I’m good at fixing things. I fixed a chair last time.
There’s one less leg after fixing it, though.
That’s why Arden said he’ll help me.
Did Uncle Arden fix it?
No, I haven’t seen the chair since.
I'd better not leave it to Arden.
I can also fix small furniture, but a house is too much.
I wonder if you have ever repaired the witch's house.
Okay, thank you. I’ll ask Kyla.
Wouldn't it be somewhat better to leave that to Kyla?
House repair? Why do you ask me about that?
My tools are a knife and spatula. Not a saw and hammer.
Should I ask Kyla instead?
Kyla would be better since she’s skilled.
But it’s a witch's house.
Well, wouldn’t someone like Kyla be good enough? You should ask her in person.
Repairing the witch's house? Did you ask the Witches' Catalogue?
Yes... Is there any other way?
I don't know...
Things made by witches are special.
But I heard that craftsmen who are not witches can also do so if they are skilled.
Yeah, wouldn’t someone like Kyla be good enough?
I think I should go ask her myself.
Witch's house?
Have you ever repaired one before?
Witch's houses are normally repaired by witch craftsmen.
I could try to repair it if it is a simple issue.
Wow, that’s great too.
It won't be that good though.
Have you talked to a witch craftsmen?
There is a situation that I can’t mention...
Is that so? Hmm...
Alright, I’ll help you since I owe you one.
I’m not sure if I can but I’ll do my best.
Thank you so much.
I don't need payment, but there are ingredients I can't get. So you have to get them for me.
I’ll list them on a note.
Yeah, okay.
I think it will take about a day once I get the ingredients.
Hello.
Enjoy your trip, little witch.
I don’t have anything to tell you.
I’ve collected the ingredients.
Good job. I'll start working on it now.
It will take about a day.
Okay, thank you.
I wish I can catch salmon.
I'm getting tired.
It's obvious where I'm going.
I wonder how many will bite today.
Time doesn’t seem to pass.
I didn’t sell anything in particular.
Wow, this tastes awful.
Can I go to sleep now?
Now you can’t use it anymore.
Sorry, you can't go beyond here.
Why did the train stop?
There is [em1]something[/em1] in the train's path.
We're working on getting rid of whatever's in the way.
Something's in our way? Is it a boa constrictor?
A boa constrictor? No, no. It's a strange [em1]prickly vine[/em1].
A strange prickly vine?
Yes, a prickly vine. It wasn't there yesterday, but it seems to have grown overnight.
We can't seem to cut it down with a regular axe, but we're doing our best.
We've contacted the witches, so I'm sure they'll be here to help in no time.
Can I take a look? I happen to be a witch.
You're our passenger. It's our responsibility to make sure you're safe.
We'll take care of it, so please be patient.
Can I just take a peek...?
I'm sorry.
Is there any way I can help?
How long will this take?
All you have to do is sit tight.
Oh, geez.
If we can take care of it on our own, it shouldn't take long.
But it might take some time if it is a problem that we can’t solve.
Look, Ellie! It's a [em1]quest mark[/em1]!
All I see is dust and cobwebs that we have to [em1]clean up[/em1].
Exactly!
Let’s find something useful while [em1]cleaning[/em1].
My legs still hurt.
Would you like to try this?
Wow, what's this? Is this candy?
Yeah, it’s a candy to heal your leg.
Wow, thanks. It looks delicious.
Oh, it’s delicious.
Ugh, this tastes awful.
It’s good for your health. 
How’s your leg?
Well, I think I feel better.
Thanks, Ellie.
The candy tastes awful.
Ellie, can I follow you too?
Wouldn’t it be better to rest a little more?
I'm bored since I'm at home all the time. What do you say?
Okay, fine. But be careful.
Okay, thanks!
It wouldn’t hurt to try. Let’s go.
Treasure map!
What about the gigantic prickly vine?
Oh well. We can't do much about it yet.
So, how did you get caught in the spiderweb?
I just came to the forest to play for a little bit.
But time flew by, and by then the [em1]giant prickly vines[/em1] were covering the way.
I was looking for another path, when I heard the [em1]sound of a train[/em1].
Oh, it must be the one I was riding.
I went towards the train and a [em1]strange bird[/em1] suddenly started chasing after me...
It must have been that bird, not the train.
It was that bird.
I went into a deep place as I was running away...
Then I found a treasure map and got caught in a spiderweb as I was trying to pick it up.
I saw a picture of a skeleton through the bushes.
I saw in a children's book that it's a sign of pirates leaving their treasures!
Shall we go check?
Good, I think it’s working properly.
Let’s pass by quickly and find the nucleus in the meantime.
There is no response.
That means there is no such book.
Did you find the [em1]bait[/em1]?
No, not yet.
It's probably at the [em1]entrance of the town[/em1].
You should find the town if you keep walking towrads the [em1]right[/em1]. Take a look around the [em1]prickly vines[/em1].
Yes, I have it here.
Oh, that’s the one. Thanks.
This is the best catch as I expected.
Anyway, thanks for finding it. I'll give you a [em1]fish[/em1]. This one's tasty.
Blegh. I don't like fish.
I'll be fishing all day long, so just drop by if you want to talk.
It’s this one, right?
Did you make that bait yourself?
Huh? Yeah, I made it. Why?
Nothing. I just thought it's well made.
Oh, yeah?
Do you happen to know [em1]how to get rid of the gigantic prickly vine[/em1] in front of the village?
Oh, can I ask you something?
What is it?
Okay…
If that thing appears from time to time, I'll have to wait helplessly.
I heard you rescued [em1]Rubrum[/em1].
Yes, he was stuck in the spiderweb inside the forest.
Rubrum seems calm, but he runs around like a wild animal when he goes into the forest.
Thank you. Let me give you a fish.
Do you catch lots of fish?
Huh? Yeah, it's not so bad.
What about you?
I got rid of the small prickly vines, but there are giant prickly vines blocking the entrance of the village.
I'm thinking about how to get rid of them.
Right? Even a sharp axe won't make a dent in them. 
You just have to wait until they disappear.
Hm... I want to hurry up and go inside the town.
Before that, why don't you just get rid of a [em1]vine by the lake[/em1]?
It's blocking the path, too.
Where?
It's directly behind me and slightly south. Check it out if you have time.
Okay! I'll take a look.
Oh, I saw it too. 
What’s behind it?
Maybe there was a way to another forest?
Another forest!
You mean the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] right behind it, right?
I’ll go right now!
Is this a prickly vine fragment?
Fascinating.
Do you happen to know something about it?
No, I don't.
Oh, okay.
What’s this?
It’s a [em1]prickly vine fragment[/em1] that was at the village entrance.
You removed this? That’s awesome.
Okay, good bye.
But why are you giving this to me?
Because I'm wondering if you know something about it.
Prickly vine? Of course I don't.
No, hmm, wait. Use this as a [em1]bait[/em1] and...
<shake>Argh! What are you doing?!</shake>
Shh, keep your mouth shut.
<shake>How can you just throw it?!</shake>
Oh, well. Wait a minute.
Animals don’t eat what they can’t digest.
Oh, something is biting.
So the fact that it bit, means that it is [em1]something that can digest[/em1] this.
Hmm, it’s a [em1]moonlight mullet[/em1].
It’s famous as a fish that gives off real [em1]moonlight[/em1].
The fact that this guy was biting...
Means the [em1]moonlight[/em1] can get rid of the [em1]<wave>prickly vine</wave>[/em1]!
Wow, thank you. I think I can get rid of the prickly vines now.
Oh, is this a fragment of that prickly vine?
Yes, that's right. Do you know something about it?
No, I don’t know anything about prickly vines either.
But I have something that might be helpful.
Something that might be helpful?
Tada, [em1]<wave>a universal product appraisal machine</wave>[/em1]
Wow! What’s that?
It's a tool made by some witch.
With the [em1]power of the moon[/em1] of the moonstone embedded here, you can find out [em1]the identity[/em1] of any object.
Really? Then hurry up and try it!
Alright. Here it goes.
The prickly vine fragment... has disappeared!
That’s strange... Why did it disappear...?
I don't usually do this for free, but since you lifted my curse...
I’ll do it for free this time.
Wow, that's great.
There are no plants that just [em1]gets killed by moonlight[/em1], right?
This tool just shoots [em1]moonlight[/em1] and analyzes the reflected light.
A plant that gets killed by [em1]moonlight[/em1]...?
Oh, I remember now!
Maybe because of a grudge against nature?
No, that’s not possible.
That's right, this prickly vine definitely [em1]avoids the moon[/em1]! That’s why [em1]it died in the moonlight[/em1].
I'm glad the tool is working fine.
Thank you. I think I can get rid of the prickly vines now.
No, I'm the one who should be thankful. Work hard.
Think, Ellie. This is something you learned in school.
I think I've also heard of plants like that.
[em1]Avoiding the moon[/em1]! They're plants that get killed by moonlight.
<shake>Ugh, it seems like something’s coming up in my mind...</shake>
“Monthly Gardening"
“Planting flowers around vines by design is a poor design choice indeed.”
“Woman of the Red Vineyard"
“A bag among the grape vines. A familiar scent of ripe grapes. Her scent.”
It's a romance novel. Or a criminal mystery.
It's no a big deal.
You can come to the witch's house anytime you want.
Are you going to stay here?
Yeah, I think I’ll keep staying here as an apprentice.
Really. Keep up the good work, Rubrum.
Okay! Keep up the good work too, Ellie!
Hurry up and go home for now.
Your grandma must be worried. I'll find you later.
Okay! See you in a bit!
Really? Really?
Woohoo! The [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1] is ready!
Let’s go get rid of the prickly vine now!
Anyone there?
Is anybody there?
Seems like nobody is here.
It could be an abandoned witch's house.
Because the witch administration can't figure out everything.
Alright, let's go inside!
The house is a bit messy.
We’ll just sleep for one day. Who cares?
But you have to go to [em1]Highlion[/em1].
What a shame.
West - Green Forest, North - Witch's House, East - Wisteria
The town lies to the [em1]east[/em1] of here.
I guess people do live around here.
I want to go into the village.
There's the [em1]town[/em1], Virgil!
I guess the village is toward the [lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))].
I wanted to see the village. What a pity.
Alright, let's head east.
But it seems to be blocked by something over there.
That’s true. It’s [lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))].
Let’s go take a look first.
Let’s go take a look at the thing that’s blocking the path.
It's too dark and worn down for me to see anything.
I don't see any words. Only pictures...
Let's come back when it's brighter.
Is this the sign for the witch's house?
It's different from what I'm used to.
It's because it's old.
Wow. It won't even budge!
It must be stronger than the secret door in the principal's office.
What are these [em1]fragments[/em1] coming out of it?
Huh? Where?
Around your feet. 
Hello. Do you live in the town?
Nature is so beautiful.
Aren't the trees beautiful? Their green leaves are so pretty...
Oh... Sure...
Nature is so breathtaking.
You must love nature.
How can you not?
Okay, I'll be back.
Walk under the blue sky and experience nature!
She must really love nature.
So much that she can't have a conversation?
You should respect her interests.
I think it's more of an obsession.
Something didn't feel right.
You think she's [em1]cursed[/em1] or something?
A [em1]curse[/em1] that doesn't allow her to talk about anything except nature?
The [em1]curse[/em1] of a nature lover? That doesn't make sense.
There are lots of quirky witches out there.
Alright, now let’s make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1] to lift the curse.
Oh, but we can’t use the machining tool now.
I must process what’s been collected to make potion. What should I do?
You picked up several ingredients at the [em1]workplace[/em1]earlier, didn’t you?
Those would be enough to make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1].
And did you see what's next to her, over there?
Next to her? What?
It's a glass bottle that would be perfect as an [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "ExtractorGlassBottle_Name"))][/em1].
Woah, you're weren't kidding!
The [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1] that can lift the curse should be a basic recipe...
And to receive that glass bottle as a reward.
That would be nice.
You made [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1] earlier.
I guess I can just give it to her.
Alright, now let’s lift the curse.
First, let’s check on the [em1]candy that can lift the curse[/em1] in the [em1]book[/em1].
I love this forest.
The season rarely changes, so it's always filled with green trees.
Nature is so incredible.
Have you heard the sound of water flowing from the stream?
That beautiful subtle sound...
Nature is full of fascinating secrets.
Let's look for the mysterious secrets hidden between the giant trees!
Blessings from mother nature!
It's so beautiful.
Yes! It’s really really beautiful!
Rubrum, can you go to the prickly vines and wait for us there?
We'll come as soon as the Moon Oil is ready.
I'll be waiting in front of the vines.
Now we can just pick up [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))] and make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1].
We can't just leave.
Let's look around a bit more.
Are you okay?
Yeah... Probably.
Can you walk?
Then let’s go to the witch's house together.
Yeah... I’m okay.
I can’t walk because my legs hurt.
You were probably up there for too long.
Then I'll give you a hug.
I’ll give you treatment at the witch's house.
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Good, I got the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))].
Let's go back to Rubrum now.
Wow, it's so dark.
If you're scared, we can go back to the train.
I love it!!!
Let's hurry.
It's a [em1]secret passageway[/em1], Virgil!
I don't think it's a secret or a passageway.
I bet there's a path beyond here.
A mountain!
That's a bad thing, right?
I always hated mountains.
My leather gets worn out from all the wind.
Look at this, Virgil.
This must be the [em1]bait[/em1] that [em1]Rosie[/em1] mentioned.
Hey, this is pretty good! I can sense its [em1]magic[/em1].
I heard that items made by skilled [em1]artisans[/em1] become filled with [em1]magic[/em1], as if made by a witch.
I guess that was true.
That bear is more talented than it looks.
Let's take it to [em1]Rosie[/em1].
It's a fish made of wood.
It looks like [em1]bait[/em1].
But I wonder who it belongs to.
Let's look around the forest and find out.
Alright.
I must find the handle to use the Roaster.
Should I use the metal handle I have for the Roaster?
Don’t use
Good, now I can use the Roaster.
Good work. You’ll be able to make more potions.
You should pick up the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))].
Pick up two of them while you’re at it.
I must change the glass bottle to use the Extractor.
Should I use the glass bottle I have for the Extractor?
Good, now I can use the Extrator.
We can finally make potions properly.
Then what do I do now?
Didn’t you want to go to the village?
You should remove the gigantic prickly vine.
That’s true but...
It seems impossible to get rid of that huge thing with the recipe I have now.
The basic recipe does seem kinda inadequate.
What’s your plan?
Now that the [em1]Extractor[/em1] has been fixed, you'll be able to make potions from the [em1]basic recipes[/em1].
If you make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))][/em1], you can get rid of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1]...
A little more... Yeah, so the forest...
I’ll be able to go to the places that have been blocked!
Let’s look through the forest! There must be something!
What’s this? It’s locked.
That’s because we’re running out of time.
What are you talking about?
Anyway, you won’t be able to open this box now.
Then when can I open it?
Later. 
First, since it's a big bag, just wait.
Let’s get rid of the weed first.
There’s too much.
It would take forever to pull all this out using hands.
Take a look at the bin over there.
It might have a potion to get rid of weed.
Wow, it really has one.
I guess the witch who was here originally made a few of them.
Hmm... There are 3.
But that's not much.
I don’t think I can get rid of them completely with this.
Well, then you’d have to use your hands.
It doesn't look like there's anything here, so let's do the front of the house later.
There’s nothing here.
Then we'll have to use another tool.
Is there another tool?
Yes, there is a wonderful tool.
What’s that?
Your hands.
Ah...
Alright, I think I got rid of all of them, right?
It’s nice to see that it’s clean.
Now it's time to tidy up the house.
Alright, let's go to the dispensary now. 
I should make [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))].
The village is to the right.
The village will be around here.
Let’s go to the village first.
Let’s meet the village chief first.
Let’s go to sleep for today.
I must make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1] before I leave.
Quit acting like a saint!
This place seems fun to you, that's all.
Virgil, try not to say stuff that makes me sound like a bad guy, will you?
It’s a [em1]<wave>Happy Ending</wave>[/em1] for all if I have fun and they’re happy, isn’t it?
Will the teachers get angry?
"Like mother, like daughter..." That's what they'll say.
Well that's great!
I already told you. It's not a compliment.
Alright! Let’s head to the village now!
Someone must be living here.
Then wouldn’t it be best if you left them alone?
Besides, you’re about to leave.
I wonder if Rosie lives here?
Seems so, based on that fishing rod.
She really does live in the Woods.
Enite, the box by the village entrance with a candle placed on top has burned away.
Not again... I'll have to place another box in it's stead.
But why’re you leaving the candles there like that?
A [em1]Firekeeper[/em1]?
It’s [em1]someone who takes care of the flames[/em1] in the village, especially [em1]will-o' the-wisps.[/em1]
I’m afraid that until the [em1]Firekeeper[/em1] returns, this is the only solution, however uncomfortable it may be.
So the candles fell over by themselves?
No... Usually it’s [em1]Arden[/em1].
Huh? Arden?
I think it’s best if you ask him yourself.
I don’t think it’s safe to keep using those candles like that.
But no one can light the streetlamp, and I’m afraid it’s awfully dark at night.
Then I’ll try and light the streetlamps.
You would do that?
Sure, I won’t be as professional as a Firekeeper, but I can give it a try.
It’d be great if you could do that for us.
Leave it to me!
Ever since the [em1]Firekeeper[/em1] left the village, we couldn’t use the streetlamp.
So we took turns lighting candles to illuminate the roads when it got dark.
Then I’ll leave it to you.
First, I should go see [em1]Arden.[/em1]
I have to find out what happened.
Nothing but ruins here as well.
Ellie! A moment, if you will...
Sniff... Sniff...
Why are you smelling me...?
This scent is unmistakable.
<shake>But I took a shower today!</shake>
You’ve had an encounter with a [em1]Ritoring[/em1]!
It’s a creature that looks like an [em1]acorn[/em1] with a face, arms and legs attached to it.
Have you seen such a creature?
Yeah, I have.
I was picking a flower when a strange acorn appeared and surprised me.
It certainly is quite the sight at first glance.
Ritorings plant [em1]seeds[/em1] in the ground in order to preserve the forest.
They plant anything that looks like seeds in the ground.
That’s why they sometimes even plant [em1]other Ritorings[/em1] or even plant [em1]themselves[/em1].
Themselves?
They say that if you save a buried Ritoring, it’ll give you a [em1]gift[/em1] in return.
That [em1]gift[/em1] is very important.
Gifts from Ritorings are in high demand as [em1]ingredients[/em1].
<shake>You’re not trying to tell me in a roundabout way that I smell, are you?</shake>
Of course not. Ritorings are creatures you can find in the forest.
Besides, you smell nice, so there’s no need to worry.
I smell [em1]<shake>nice</shake>[/em1]<shake>...?</shake>
In a [em1]good[/em1] way.
No, I don’t think I’ve seen any.
Considering you have the scent of a Ritoring on you, I’d say you passed by it without noticing.
<shake>A scent...</shake>
That’s why they can be exchanged for [em1]Luna Coins[/em1].
2 Luna Coins for 1 Ritoring’s Gift.
Let me know if you’re in need of anything.
What do you wish to know about Ritorings?
Description
Where to Find Them
Exchange Gifts
Tell me more about the Ritorings.
Where can I find Ritorings?
No, not at the moment.
Ahem, I understand.
A Ritoring is a creature that resembles an [em1]acorn[/em1].
It looks like a cute acorn with a face and tiny hands and feet attached to it.
It’s still unclear as to whether Ritorings are [em1]animals[/em1], [em1]plants[/em1], or an entirely different species.
That’s why some people believe them to be [em1]Forest Fairies[/em1] that preserve the forest.
But upon closer inspection, you’ll find that they don’t exactly do that.
All they do is just plant [em1]seeds[/em1] into the ground.
They plant [em1]anything that looks like seeds[/em1], if we’re being precise.
Other Ritorings, tiny balls, pebbles, even themselves.
And so, once you save a buried Ritoring, it will hand you a [em1]gift[/em1] and scurry off somewhere.
They usually have a [em1]tall flower[/em1] in their hands.
Ritorings can be found in the midst of forests like these where people rarely visit.
[em1]Bug nets[/em1] cost 10 Gold Coins.
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "WitchFairyCake_Name"))][/em1] costs 1 [em1]Ritoring’s Gift[/em1].
That’s why some people believe a [em1]Ritoring Village[/em1] exists in the Woods.
Woah, a Ritoring Village!
But you’ll find that Ritorings aren’t that different compared to other creatures.
Perhaps us humans simply thought them to be intriguing?
You’re smarter than I thought, Diane. I guess first impressions aren’t everything.
Just what exactly did you think of me before...
I haven’t really seen any lying around.
They’re probably [em1]hiding[/em1] here and there.
Ritorings are normally [em1]buried in the ground[/em1].
They can also be stuck in [em1]Trees[/em1] or [em1]Bushes[/em1].
But they tend to hold a [em1]tall flower[/em1] in their hands, so you’ll be able to find one by looking for that.
Alright. I’ll try to find one.
You don’t have enough [em1]Ritoring’s Gifts[/em1].
Alright then, that’ll be 10 Gold Coins.
You can find Ritorings in the forest.
Pay careful attention to the flowers.
Is there anything else you need?
Okay then, let me know if you’ve changed your mind.
I have it here.
Payment received.
Here’s your [em1]Bug Net[/em1].
Thank you for your business.
Alright then, that’ll be 1 [em1]Ritoring’s Gift[/em1].
I need to think it over a bit more.
Here you go.
Here’s your [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "WitchFairyCake_Name"))][/em1].
Alright, I’ll be here whenever you need me.
Is there anything else you want to discuss about Ritorings?
I want to go!
The [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice Recipe[/em1] costs 1 [em1]Ritoring’s Gift[/em1].
A [em1]Witch’s Bug Net[/em1] is a tool used by witches to collect creatures.
It’s used to collect small creatures like [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FairyButterfly_Name"))], and [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "ShadowFrog_Name"))].
You’ve heard of the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "WitchFairyCake_Name"))], right?
You betcha! My mom would buy one for me at the end of the week if I’ve been good for a whole week.
Our wares include the famed Nubicula products.
Nubicula Cupcake! I’ve never tried one before! The lines were always too long...
I’ll give you one as a freebie.
Woah, really? Thanks!
What I have right now is the same thing used in the School for Witches.
Oh, those...
You must’ve used them recently, since you’ve just graduated.
I’d always get splinters, so I’d have to sand down the handle before using it.
We make sure they go through an extra quality assurance check, so you needn’t worry that much.
That’s a relief.
So I’ve hardly ever had a chance to eat one.
This is the Twinkle-Twinkle Juice?
Correct, this is the Twinkle-Twinkle Juice.
I’ve always wanted to have the recipe for it. 
After all, no one would be able to study if half the class is shining brightly like a star.
This is the juice that makes your whole body shine brightly.
We’d always gather around some place dark, like an alley behind the school, and drink it in secret.
But it’s one of the concoctions the teachers would never teach us.
Obviously we’d all get caught, since we were all glowing.
Well, now that you’re an apprentice witch, you can make it without any worries.
Of course, with it comes great responsibility.
Here’s the [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice recipe[/em1].
It should’ve been automatically added to your [em1]book[/em1]. Go check it out.
The [em1]Bug Net[/em1] has been unlocked.
The [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))] Recipe[/em1] costs 1 [em1]Ritoring’s Gift[/em1].
The recipe for the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))].
Here’s the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))] recipe[/em1].
It’s purpose is for therapeutic uses, but in reality the potion is widely misused for entertainment.
Entertainment?
That’s right. You can fool around in your dreams.
After all, you can have all kinds of experiences safely in your dreams.
But be warned, for it is precisely this reason why it can be addictive.
Alright, got it.
You don’t have enough Gold Coins.
You’re here to exchange Ritoring’s Gifts!
[em1]1[/em1] Ritoring’s Gift can be exchanged for [em1]2[/em1] Luna Coins.
How many do you wish to exchange?
You don’t have any Ritoring’s Gifts at the moment.
You can exchange them whenever you want.
[em1]1[/em1] Ritoring’s Gift will be exchanged for [em1]2[/em1] Luna Coins.
Thank you. I’ve exchanged them for you.
Please, take all the time you need to think it over.
Do you wish to exchange more?
I’ll be here whenever you need me.
[em1]3[/em1] Ritoring’s Gifts will be exchanged for [em1]6[/em1] Luna Coins.
[em1]10[/em1] Ritoring’s Gifts will be exchanged for [em1]20[/em1] Luna Coins.
So far, you’ve exchanged a total of...
[var=System.RitoringPresentNumber] Ritoring’s Gift(s).
You’re just getting started. Keep it up!
Wow, you gathered a lot!
Amazing! Just a bit more and you’ll find them all!
I believe you’ve found all of them in this forest. Congratulations!
[em1]A burned box[/em1]?
Wasn’t there a [em1]candle[/em1] placed on top? I wonder what happened?
Either the candle toppled over, or someone screwed up while lighting it.
That’s what you get for placing a candle on a wooden box.
Tell me about it. Why would they leave it like this? It’s not safe!
(Should I go tell [em1]Enite[/em1]?)
Let’s go see [em1]Enite[/em1] and ask her what happened.
Even I know that.
Hmm... Someone else will notice, right?
I should go tell her as soon as possible.
Accept
Decline
Now Arden won’t be burning any boxes.
It’s dangerous to leave it like this. I have to do something about it.
What color do you want the [em1]streetlamp[/em1] to glow in, Enite?
I’d like the streetlamp to glow with a pretty color, like a [em1]pink [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FairyButterfly_Name"))][/em1].
I’m not sure... I just want people to take a stroll at night without getting hurt.
But if you had to choose, what color would you like?
Hmm, let’s see now. If I had to choose, I’d like it to be [em1]pink[/em1].
Pink?
What’s wrong? Is that too strange?
No, just unexpected.
Might as well be pretty, wouldn’t you agree? I myself prefer the colors of a pink [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FairyButterfly_Name"))][/em1].
Of course. I understand.
What color do you want the [em1]streetlamp[/em1] to glow in, Rubrum?
I’d love it if the streetlamp glowed [em1]yellow[/em1] like a [em1]firefly[/em1]!
You’re going to light the streetlamp?
Yeah, I’m gonna give it a shot.
Yay, now I can play at night, too!
I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
I’m the one lighting the streetlamp, so it won’t be as bright as before.
You should still be careful during the night so you don’t get hurt.
So what color do you want the streetlamp to glow with?
Oh, oh! I want it to be sparkling [em1]yellow[/em1]!
Alright, I’ll give it a go.
[em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1], complete!
Don’t drink it.
Wasn’t gonna.
I’m gonna make some [em1]extra[/em1] for myself later.
I should give this to [em1]Enite[/em1].
Alright, I’ve asked everyone.
Quite the varying tastes.
Enite likes [em1]pink[/em1], Arden likes [em1]silver[/em1], and Rubrum likes [em1]yellow[/em1]...
What color do you want, Virgil?
[em1]Turquoise[/em1], just like my glowing eyes.
You can’t make Twinkle-Twinkle Juice of that color.
Then which color do you prefer, Ellie?
Hmm, let’s see...
Pink
Silver
Yellow
Something else
I like Enite’s [em1]pink[/em1].
It’s cute and fluffy-wuffy.
I like Arden’s [em1]silver[/em1].
I like Rubrum’s [em1]yellow[/em1].
I think a different color would be better.
Let's make a [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1] of that color!
Silver is probably best to really light up the night.
A mellow yellow would fit this village best.
Twinkle-Twinkle Juice has limited colors, you know.
I know.
First thing’s first, let’s get the [em1]Recipe[/em1].
Go see [em1]Diane[/em1]. She should be selling it.
Okay!
I could just give her a pre-made one as well.
I’m well aware of the [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1].
Do you sell the [em1]Recipe[/em1] as well?
We sure do! The [em1]Recipe[/em1] is in stock as well.
Please check the Witches Catalogue.
I’ve caught some small fries here and there so that sucks, but it’s going fine.
What’s up?
Enite wanted me to give you this.
Oh, Enite baked some more pie.
It looks delicious.
... Yeah, Enite’s pies sure are tasty.
Thanks for the pie.
Tell Enite I said thanks as well.
Enite will be happy to hear that you loved the pie.
Wish I could share your sentiment.
Yeah, she’s always worried that you eat nothing but fish.
... Even though I’ve told her not to worry...
Parents are just like that.
Even if you say you’re fine, they’re not satisfied.
Oh, I get it!
I drink Twinkle-Twinkle Juice once in a blue moon...
...but my Dad always worries about me, saying how I drink the stuff more than I have meals.
No matter how old you are, to a parent, your child is always just a child.
Not to mention I’ve got this worrywart of a hat.
Back when I was your age, Ellie...
In any case, I helped bake the pie.
Yet I still can’t help but think of my parents.
I’ve got it right here.
Oh, thanks.
Fine. You want to know [em1]how to breathe fire[/em1], is that it?
Yup!
I wasn’t too sure myself, so I thought it through step-by-step to teach you.
Alright!
First, [em1]breathe in[/em1].
Then, heat up the [em1]crimson tooth[/em1] from deep within.
Okay...?
Then squeeze the [em1]pouch[/em1] in your throat to release the liquid.
I’ll teach you step-by-step.
Once you exhale, flames will come forth.
How does that sound?
It won’t work!
What’s the problem?
I can breathe in just fine.
But I don’t have a [em1]crimson tooth[/em1] to heat up!
Have you properly heated up your tooth?
I see.
It can’t end like this...
After all, you’re not a dragon.
My lifelong dream...
So what if you can’t breathe fire?
<shake>It’s not as simple as that!</shake>
All it does is hurt your throat. Not really useful at all.
Treasure?
Here, you did me a favor, so have this bread.
Back in the old days, I used it to threaten the humans who were after my [em1]treasure[/em1].
But nowadays I just use it to increase the heat when I'm boiling a stew.
Where is it now? Did you hide it in a secret cave?
Can’t remember.
What happened to the people who were after your treasure?
Can you really forget something so important?
It happens.
This must be the village bulletin board.
So this is where they post all their chores.
It’s also filled with other people’s exciting stories.
But there’s nothing here right now.
<shake>Caww!</shake>
<shake> Caww!</shake> Spit it out!

It spoke?
It’s a witch’s crow.
Oh, it’s a witch’s crow.

This is my first time coming here, though.

The Witches’ Catalogue!
I’ve always wanted to try it out.
You need to head towards Highlion, young lady.
But I can’t just starve until I reach the village.
After I find the village, I’m gonna make sure I try it out before I go to Highlion.

[em1]<shake>Closed for the day!</shake>[/em1]
So suddenly?
It’s not easy getting the message across to Witch’s Crows.
Hmm, then I guess I should keep searching for the village.
You never know when the Witches’ Catalogue will show up.
Let’s stick to the plan and find the village.
Work finished! Work finished! <shake>Closed for the day!</shake>
I don't need to sleep.
I have to return to the train.
Let’s meet the village chief first and then rest.
I shouldn’t sleep now.
I’m not sleepy yet.
I should clean this place up first.
Something on your mind?
Want some water?
Is this my dream?
It’s darker than I thought.
Virgil isn’t here either.
Hello, Mr. Bartender.
Hey! Want a drink?
No, I don't drink alcohol. Do you have any tea?
Then I’ll have a cup of that.
The tea has alcohol, though. Is that okay?
But then that’s just alcohol. Alcohol with tea.
Potato, potahto.
You know your way out, right?
The [em1]exit[/em1] is [em1]next to the sofa[/em1] down there.
I knew that.
... Then can I ask you a question instead of a drink?
Anytime.
Huh? That’s no weed.
What was that? It left something behind.
A Ritoring.
Ritoring?
That’s a cute name.
Why was it buried there?
Someone could’ve buried it...
...or it could’ve been sleeping.
You’re gonna have to be more specific than that.
There’s not much that’s known about Ritorings.
Well, other than good fortune if you find one?
Yeah, I guess it did leave behind a gift of sorts.
Try to spot them while you’re wandering around.
Okay! I’ll look for more.
This must be what Diane mentioned!
Looks cute.
That’s cute?
An acorn with arms, legs, and a face?
C’mon, it’s cute.
I can [em1]exchange[/em1] them for [em1]Luna Coins[/em1] thanks to [em1]Diane[/em1], so I should gather as many as I can.
Ritoring? Wha’s that?
You’ve never seen one?
It looks like an acorn with arms, legs, and a face.
Oh, those.
One of them popped out while I was pulling at a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))].
I believe it matched your description.
Anything particular about the incident?
I saw it once. There’s not much else to say.
A Ritoring? First time I’ve heard such a thing.
It’s like an acorn, but with arms, legs, and a face.
Oh, you mean the Spirit of the Forest.
A Spirit?
It grants the finder good luck...
... Or grants you special powers...
... Lots of rumors like that.
You’ve seen one before, Aurea?
No, unfortunately I’ve never seen one myself.
But you hear things here and there as you do business as a merchant.
It’s an acorn, but with arms, legs, and a face.
Oh!
I saw one in the woods.
I wanted to catch it, but it was too fast for me.
Let me know if you see one again.
Okay! Let me know if you find one too, Ellie!
Ice Castle. [em1]Warning[/em1]. Ruins.
It’s the ruins of an Ice Castle.
I want to take a closer look, but the way is blocked.
It could be dangerous. We shouldn’t push it.
Cliffside Cave. Warning. Steep slopes.
A cave!!!
Just think about all the weird creatures crawling around!
Calm down. The path is blocked, so you can’t go there yet.
It looks familiar...
Does it remind you of the garden cat from the School for Witches?
That’s not it.
Strange... I could’ve sworn I saw it from somewhere.
Considering there’s a statue, it seems to be a God revered around these parts.
A Cat...God?
Though it doesn’t seem to be in great shape.
That’s it, Virgil!
What, a Quest giver? Is it a commissioning statue?
...Huh?
No, it’s the Cat God I met in my dreams!
So it’s the source of that evil.
The Cat God asked for help, you know.
Either way, it must not be a well-respected God.
There’s zero signs of any maintenance being done.
I guess... Maybe there’s more to the story?
Wisteria.
The village is just ahead.
Temple of the Cat God.
Based on the sign, there should’ve been a road...
The sign is broken and the road is blocked.
Maybe the God is angry?
Do you know why the train stopped all of a sudden?
I saw a [em1]mysterious tree[/em1] outside the window.
Let me know if you need anything to drink.
I've been here with you the whole time.
I know as much as you.
Does the train stop often?
No. Never.
Time is money. If there's no good reason, [em1]it never stops[/em1].
When they fix the problem, I'm sure we'll take off [em1]right away[/em1].
The crew member just said we'll be leaving [em1]tomorrow morning[/em1].
Oh, then I guess we're leaving tomorrow morning.
A [em1]mysterious tree?[/em1] What did it look like?
It was a [em1]gigantic shining tree[/em1]. 
A [em1]shining tree?[/em1] I've never heard of such a thing.
If it was a large tree, it must be somewhere nearby.
Huh, like the one I just mentioned?
Hm, but that tree wasn't shining...
It was just a [em1]large tea tree[/em1]. 
Where was the tree?
There's a path that leads to it, but I can't remember exactly...
It was located somewhere up the [em1]sloping road[/em1] beyond the [em1]lake[/em1].
I'm going to go there now! Thank you!
Don’t forget, the train will leave once the problem’s fixed.
I wonder what’s out there?
I took a look outside now that the train’s stopped...
...And it looks like we’re near the [em1]Village[/em1] where I used to live.
There’s a [em1]Village[/em1]?
It’s nowhere to write home about.
Nothing compared to a sprawling city like Highlion.
Sounds better than a boring old Witch’s House.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Why are you working here as a bartender, and not at a shop?
I may not look the part, but I used to be quite the big deal back in the day.
What sort of work do you do here?
Cocktails are my specialties.
I like making drinks, but I like drinking them as well.
I'm mixing my life and changing the alcohol.
Wait, I think it's the other way around.
I'm just an average [em1]bartender[/em1] working in the most expensive place in the world.
What brings you to this very expensive train?
I thought you were listening to our conversation?
I stopped listening when it got boring.
I'm going to be an [em1]apprentice[/em1] at the witch's house in [em1]Highlion[/em1].
After working as an apprentice for [em1]3 years[/em1], I will able to [em1]graduate[/em1] from the School for Witches.
Wow! [em1]Highlion[/em1], huh? That’s a right proper place, isn’t it?
So they say.
That's probably why you got the train ticket for free.
You must be someone special.
I don't really care about that kind of thing, though.
[em1]“That kind of thing”[/em1] is what's important at the end of the day.
It’s best to just suck it up. You’ll be glad you did later down the road, you know.
Yeah, [em1]“later”[/em1]...
I used to own a [em1]bar[/em1].
In this area?
Sure did. My wife and I, the [em1]two of us[/em1]...
Woah, you’re both bartenders.
I met her at work, after all.
We had to move due to circumstances, though, so here we are now.
I hope a time comes when you two open up shop again.
Anyone ask?
Virgil, shut up.
You must’ve been very popular.
There were customers who’d visit the bar just to see me.
Even to this day, I still take pride in these [em1]eyebrows[/em1] of mine.
After all, even my wife said she fell in love with them.
Woah...
A romantic tale that starts with eyebrows...
Have you ever gone fishing before?
I don’t think the fish are that eager to show up today.
Or maybe I just suck at fishing.
You have to be careful in the Woods.
Come back once you’ve gotten used to the Woods. I’ll teach you.
Don’t you get bored, sitting and waiting all the time?
I bet you’ll change your mind once you’ve caught yourself a fish or two.
Fishing has its own merits.
What’s that in your mouth?
It’s dried [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))].
And why do you have it in your mouth?
It helps get rid of annoying bugs and animals.
Plus, I can chew on it if I get bored.
Oh, I’ve heard you can use dried [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))] to get rid of rats.
It doesn’t seem particularly tasty...
It’s not bad once you get used to it.
You like fish?
No, not really.
Hmm... you need to appreciate the taste of fish in order to enjoy fishing.
You don’t have to eat everything you catch, though.
But it does change the name of the game.
I’ll give you a fish, since I’m always catching them.
So you can try eating it.
Um... Thanks.
Uh... I’m still not sold on it.
That’s how it always is in the beginning.
You’ll change your mind soon enough once you start eating some more.
I’ll let you have some more if I catch anything else.
Give them to someone as a gift if you really can’t stomach them.
It’s not bad, living in the Woods.
I don’t have much to talk about.
Is there anything you like?
Dunno, maybe Cloud Salmon?
You like Cloud Salmon?
Salmon spend their early years out in the ocean, and come back to the rivers once they’ve grown old.
Right.
But the path from the ocean to the rivers is narrow and its waters turbulent.
Most make it upstream, but some get lost and return to the ocean.
We call those still wandering the ocean “Cloud Salmon.”
It’s because they’re like the clouds in the sky, endlessly moving about.
But why do you like Cloud Salmon?
I’ve given up on being disappointed.
I’m just living life as it is.
It’s not so bad, living life as it is.
You live in the Woods?
How do you live in the woods?
You get used to it.
You don’t get uncomfortable?
Still better than before.
Where did you used to live?
Where I used to live. My hometown.
And the Woods are better than your hometown?
There’s some inconveniences, but overall it’s better.
There's no one to berate me.
That’s certainly a plus.
Right?
What do you do with the fish you’ve caught?
Eat them.
The meat is drenched in salt. It’s dry and tasteless.
Hearing that made me feel better.
You eat everything you catch?
Sometimes I let them go, sometimes I eat them all.
Don’t you get tired of eating fish all the time?
I’ve never really thought of it like that.
Eating the same thing day after day doesn’t sound very appealing.
Familiarity is good though.
But there’s so many delicious foods out there.
Dunno... I don’t really feel like it.
Is fishing any fun?
So-so?
Then why do you fish every day if it’s so-so?
I don’t need to think about anything when I’m fishing.
And you like not thinking about anything?
Because I don’t have to worry.
I never talked to them in person.
We crossed paths once or twice in the Woods.
Did they go to the Woods often?
The Witch’s House is in the outskirts of the Village...
... and that Witch seemed to like exploring the area just like you.
Nope. Like I said, I never spoke with her.
Still, she seemed to be friendly with the Villagers.
Hmm, alright. Let me know if you can think of anything else.
We only sell alcohol at the moment.
I should go check on Rubrum first.
I wouldn’t mind taking a nap here. Maybe later.
We’re not napping right now, though.
Agh! You scared me.
Who are you?
I'm just a witch, innocently passing by.
A witch? What are you doing here?
I was on a train, but we had to stop.
Then shouldn't you be on your way?
I keep hearing the [em1]sound of the train[/em1].
Oh, you're right.
The [em1]train[/em1] should be [em1]down below[/em1].
I saw them building the railroad tracks a long time ago.
Oh, it's you.
You didn't leave on the train yet?
Oh, the train already left. It was just a weird bird making train sounds.
Ah, you saw the strange bird.
That bird always pecks at you and keeps making weird sounds. I hate it.
Anyway, what are you going to do?
I hear there's a village nearby, so I'm going to look for it.
The village? You'll find the [em1]village[/em1] if you keep going to the [em1]right[/em1].
But, I don't think you can enter because of the [em1]prickly vines[/em1].
Prickly vines?
Yeah, it comes with the season. But I’ve my home in the Woods, so I’ll be fine.
Then what do I do?
Let's head toward the village and see the prickly vines for ourselves.
Oh! If you're going to the village, can you get my [em1]bait[/em1] for me?
[em1]Bait[/em1]?
Yeah, I lost some near the village entrance. I think it might be buried under the prickly vines.
I'll bring it if I find it.
I think I'll be here for a while since I missed the train.
You missed the train? That's strange... The train almost never stops if there's no station.
It stopped because of the prickly vines. I got off to look around and the train left without me.
Haha! Oh my...
Where are you staying now?
I was going to the village, but there are huge prickly vines blocking the way.
There's an empty witch's house nearby, so I've been staying there.
Oh, the prickly vines just reminded me.
I lost some bait near the village entrance. Have you seen it?
Is this it?
Don't you need to hurry back to the train?
Oh, I did pick up some pieces of fish at the village entrance.
I hear there's a village in the east, so I'm going to look for it.
I saw an empty Witch’s House, so I’m planning on staying there for now.
Have you been to the village? It’s to the right.
Right. You can’t even enter because of the prickly vines.
If you're going that way, can you get my bait for me?
It won’t be easy getting into the village at this time.
Oh, you’re right. There’s prickly vines blocking the entrance.
Yeah, they're always there around this time of the year.
I’ve got some business to do at the moment.
Is that so? I guess it can’t be helped then. Well, if you do still end up finding it, let me know.
A night light...? Hm. People use that?
It’s a silver lamp, but it doesn’t have a wick or candle.
I wouldn’t know even if you describe it to me like that. I’ve never seen such a thing.
The small child should be Rubrum...and if the grown-up was old enough to go into the Woods...
Actually, I think I’ve seen a small child and an adult with a lamp like that.
Obvious, isn’t it?
This must be the place Rubrum mentioned.
Let’s look for the night light.
Welcome, Ellie dearie.
Woah...! It really is done.
Yup. Thanks to you, it came out quite nicely, if I may say so myself.
It’s amazing.
I helped Kyla build her house, too.
The little tyke Rubrum sure did help.
Although, his sand castle skills could use some work.
It fills me with joy to see Kyla back and her home restored.
Ellie, Kyla, and Rubrum. Your combined efforts are what made this possible.
It's such a joyous day, so I wanted to celebrate with everyone.
Grandma gave us this, too!
We’re all gonna pop it together!
One, two, three!
From what I’ve heard, you have to take your shoes off before you step foot into Highlion Station.
You work at the train so you know what I’m talking about, right?
Oh, that story.
If you're wearing shoes of that sort, I'd advise you to untie them in advance.
See, Virgil? I was right!
“O ye who reacheth Highlion, look first upon thy shoes!” Or so that’s how the saying goes.
The preppy boots Mom gave me as a present tell me just as much.
I should have torn up that stupid [em1]ticket[/em1] right then and there.
Check out this idiotic patterning. It looks like the armpit feathers of a phoenix!
I don't know if it's from the armpit, but it definitely has [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))][/em1].
It's to prevent people from [em1]counterfeiting[/em1] such expensive tickets.
You're such a know-it-all. No one asked.
Are you enjoying the most expensive train ride in the world?
Nope. It's so boring.
Aren't you bored, Mr. Bartender?
I've gotten used to it.
But it’s certainly gotten less boring, thanks to you and your hat.
You’ve been listening?
Other guests would’ve heard about your arson at the School for Witches by now.
I didn’t set it on fire!
Uh, sure, there was a fire, but that was because I shook a potion five times and made it explode.
“Potions must be shaken three times only.” Even a non-witch like me knows that.
How can you not try shaking it four times having heard that?
But you said you shook it five times.
Nothing happened on the fourth time, so I shook it once more.
An inquisitive mind. You’ve already got the makings of a fine witch.
For a fine witch such as yourself, I’ll give you this instead of the usual spiked tea.
After all, a bartender should never let a customer leave empty-handed.
Wow, it looks delicious. Thank you!
Can I take a look at your shoes?
My shoes? What for?
Absolutely. Plenty of [em1]confused passengers[/em1] who were all dressed up for Highlion.
Those are some nice boots.
Right? My Mom bought them for me when she found out I was graduating magna cum laude.
It sure is amazing you’re graduating magna cum laude despite your antics.
You gonna keep up with that attitude of yours?
Haha. Hearing the two of you speak, I have a feeling being boredom won't be an issue.
Trains are pretty rare...
So there were lots of different opinions even before they built the first station.
That's why we ended up with these strange rules.
You’re not going to ask just one person, are you?
One is never enough, you know.
Even the greatest detectives never reach a conclusion based on a single piece of evidence.
Hmm...You have a point.
Thanks for the praise!
I don't think he was praising you.
I should be on my way then.
Alright, have a fun trip.
You can’t act like a country bumpkin once you're in the city, got it?
So, goodbye then.
Speak.
This story is foreign to me.
...Oh. Hello.
Am I disturbing you?
Negative. What’s the issue?
Oh, I want to ask you about something.
You’re on the way to Highlion, right?
What’s the matter?
Oh... it's just that you have a very blunt way of speaking.
Oh my. Old habits die hard, especially when one is deep in thought.
You sound like the janitor from my school.
Well, I used to be a soldier.
So, what brings you here?
Up ahead is the engine room.
Small talk is forbidden during operation.
I’m an attendant of Brightman Railroads.
My job is to ensure the passengers’ comfort and safety.
Please save any inquiries regarding souvenirs at the station until after we exit the train.
Alright now, have some patience and stay seated.
Ugh...
Yeah, look outside...! Look at that mountain!
It must be hiding a cave, with strange pillars, statues, and a giant door...!
Sounds like the prologue to a story where you awaken a terrible demon.
Wait, hold on! Virgil, shut up and look out the window. At the summit of the mountain.
There's a [em1]gigantic shining tree[/em1] at the top.
A [em1]<wave>gigantic shining tree</wave>[/em1]!
Why is it shining? Does it have luminous flowers? It must be beautiful up close.
Give it up. This train won't stop for two days.
Ugh... I want to get out now!
I hope we crash.
Fat chance of that happening, so just stay bored.
After all, you signed up for three years of even more boredom.
Aren't there any crocophants nearby?
Nope.
What about boa constrictors?
This isn't a jungle.
Train robbers?
This isn’t the wild west. It’s a healing game, remember?
Hey, a boa constrictor!
The correct line is, “What’s going on?”
There's no station here. Why are we stopping?
I'm not sure. Maybe there's something wrong with the train.
I doubt it's a boa constrictor, though.
I don't care if it's not a boa constrictor!
Please just say there's some massively critical issue... Please, please...
I’m bored...
But you just sat down.
This is torture...
Stare out the window if you’re so bored.
Please...
We apologise for the inconvenience.
A critical issue, perhaps?
The train cannot continue its journey due to a [em1]critical issue[/em1]...
YES!!!
Attention. The train will stop until [em1]tomorrow morning[/em1], and the departure time...
Can we go outside?
...will likely be announced tomorrow. We will depart immediately if possible...
Okay, I'll be back in a bit!
In the meantime, please avoid wandering too far from the train...
Let's go!
I'm not sure if you remember but...
Of course I remember! The shining tree is at the [em1]peak[/em1].
No, not that.
We have to get back by [em1]tomorrow morning[/em1].
Then we should get going!
This won’t do.
Hm? What won’t do? You haven’t lost your marbles, have you?
To tell you the truth, I actually met a God a few days ago.
In your dreams.
No! But that’s exactly it! I met them in my dreams!
The Cat God said that they’re the ones who stopped the train.
You don’t mean that white cat you followed on your first day, do you?
Exactly.
And I’ve been wondering ever since...
Why do they appear as a cat?
They said they protect the village. Maybe it used to be an ordinary cat?
I wonder when it became a guardian?
Calm down.
It keeps popping up in my head when I try to sleep.
So I gotta do something about it...!
I have to figure it out!
And there you go ignoring me again.
Where should I start investigating first?
If it’s related to the village...
Then I guess it’s best if I ask Enite!
Hello, Enite!
Oh, it’s you, Ellie dearie. Keeping yourself well fed, I hope?
I came here today because I wanted to ask you something.
Oh, anytime. I’ll answer as best I can, dearie.
Do you know about the White Cat God?
I sure do! The White Cat God has been the guardian of our village for ages.
Can you tell me more?
There’s a mural of the legend up north in the village...
But you’d best not go there.
It’s a dangerous place. Do try to stay away from there.
Maybe once more people return...but it’s too dangerous now.
No doubt about it...who wouldn’t go there after that?
She said dangerous, not mysterious!
An exciting adventure is just waiting for us out there!
Like mother, like daughter. Guess that adventurous streak runs in the family.
Let’s go!
For a place that’s forbidden, it’s not secured very well.
Well, a warning is usually enough to keep people away.
I think I can pry it off with a bit of elbow grease.
And once again, my words fall on deaf ears.
Alright, let’s do this.
Danger. Keep Out.
It says danger. I wonder what’s so dangerous about it?
You haven’t the faintest idea what’s inside. Don’t go in all willy-nilly.
Alright! A job well done!
If only you could clean your room with such enthusiasm.
But cleaning isn’t fun.
Oh, the horror.
Nothing comes out of it.
Let's go inside!
What’s there to wow about? You can hardly see anything.
Can’t you feel this aura, Virgil?
I’m sure there’s something amazing in here.
This damp and cool atmosphere! Absolutely blinding darkness!
A tad bit too optimistic, aren’t you?
I have to find the way out.
This must be why Enite said the place was dangerous.
Looks like the prickly vines haven’t completely overrun the village.
When it’s so dark like this, you could trip and get hurt.
Or fall and bump your head into something.
And here I thought you weren’t capable of rational thinking.
What’s a witch for, if not to solve things like this!
Ever hear the saying, 'Pretext is never wanting'?
Shut it, you!
This is a piece of cake!
Don’t get ahead of yourself. We still haven’t found the exit.
Yeah, yeah. I’ll be careful.
Woahhh...
See, Virgil? I told you something would show up.
To think the village harbored a place like this underneath it.
You think the mural that Enite mentioned is here?
My heart’s pounding with excitement! I got a good feeling about this.
But just in case, don’t go around touching everything you see.
Fine, fine, I’ll be careful.
Buzzing with excitement already, are we?
A mural!
It looks like some sort of story is written in it.
That cat statue over there...Is that the God you met?
But I met a White Cat God...
So there’s a Black Cat God as well...?
<color=#134c81>Come forth, O little Witch.</color>
Hm? What’s with the formalities, Virgil?
Seriously, quit joking around.
But I didn’t say anything.
Like heck you didn’t! You told me to come forth...
<color=#134c81>Seeketh not only the material, O little Witch.</color>
Huh...?
<color=#134c81>It has been quite some time since a creature walking on two legs has been here.</color>
Virgil...There’s a voice in my head.
I’m used to hearing you in my head...But this is something else!
<color=#134c81>Now then, what thirst of knowledge brings you to such a secluded area?</color>
Uh...First of all...
I want to know about the White Cat God!
Another God? What about the White Cat God? Why a cat? What’s this mural about?
<color=#134c81>I surmised as much, but you are quite the inquisitive Witch.</color>
<color=#134c81>First, I am a different being than that which you are aware of.</color>
<color=#134c81>Second, the reason for existence is not something a fledgling witch can understand.</color>
<color=#134c81>Third, I can indeed impart my knowledge of the mural.</color>
<color=#134c81>Do you wish to hear the story now, little Witch?</color>
Long ago, the people of this land worshiped the God of the giant tea tree atop the mountain’s summit.
<color=#134c81>Indeed, now may not be the most opportune time.</color>
They built this sanctuary as they prayed to the God, while collecting the tea leaves for themselves.
But one day, a girl came to the sanctuary in tears, praying for her ill-stricken grandmother.
<color=#134c81>Visitors such as yourself are scarce in these times. For you, I shall engrave your story into the drawing as well.</color>
<color=#134c81>Touch it, should curiosity get the better of you.</color>
Woahh...
What’re you mumbling by yourself for?
A God spoke to me in my head.
I hate to admit it...but as the daughter of Aria, it’s more than possible.
It’s true!
I knew I should’ve come here.
On that day, a black cat appeared to the girl in her dreams and spoke.
<color=#134c81>Your prayers ring true. I grant you the herb of the heavens, so heed my words.</color>
<color=#134c81>Before the sun rises tomorrow, venture to the mountains and climb atop the tallest tea tree.</color>
<color=#134c81>Pluck three white tea leaves atop the tree. Steep in the basin’s water. Drink.</color>
<color=#134c81>Then, on the first of every month, let her drink the tea, and she shall be healed.</color>
The girl followed the orders, and her grandmother was as right as rain.
An elder saw the miracle and asked the girl.
<color=#134c81>However, you must not touch the white flowers blooming amidst the top of the tea tree.</color>
“Your grandmother was on her deathbed. How did she manage to get better?”
The girl nonchalantly told her tale with the cat, and the elder heeded her words.
The next day, before sunrise, the elder headed towards the tea tree at the mountain summit.
The elder, having seen the charming flower, could not resist temptation.
As the elder’s hand touched the flower, a bolt of lighting struck the elder and the tree.
The elder fell from the burnt tree to their death.
From then on, the clear water in the stone basin of the sanctuary turned black.
The people begged for forgiveness for the elder’s sacrilege, but to no avail.
Yet the girl, who could no longer procure the medicine, prayed in tears for three days.
And so the cat appeared once again in her dreams and spoke.
<color=#134c81>Before sunrise tomorrow, climb the tea tree dressed in white.</color>
<color=#134c81>Pluck the white flower, bury it next to the tree, and pray. The basin shall sprout water once more.</color>
<color=#134c81>The tale is lengthy, so choose well.</color>
<color=#134c81>My time is infinite. It does not need to be at the present time.</color>
As soon as she woke up, the girl ventured to the mountain dressed in white.
She searched for the white flower, but a pitch black flower was in its stead.
As she witnessed the flower, her body quivered as she was struck with guilt for her actions.
Then the branch snapped and she fell to her death, clothes billowing in the air.
The next day, leaves grew from the tree and clear water sprouted from the basin.
The villagers continued with their lives, worshiping the White and Black Cat Gods of the Tea Tree.
<color=#134c81>That is the end of the story.</color>
<color=#134c81>O inquisitive Witch, do you wish to hear the first tale?</color>
<color=#134c81>Life is finite, and stories eternal.</color>
<color=#134c81>So long as your curiosity never fades, this story shall always be open to you.</color>
<color=#134c81>Oh inquisitive Witch, do you wish to hear the second tale?</color>
You can temporarily get rid of the vines with [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))].
But they’ll grow back after a while.
Find the core. It should be somewhere near the vines.
Alright, I got rid of the core.
Those annoying vines should be gone by now!
Good work.
My body isn’t what it used to be.
Could you get me some ingredients for baking pies, dearie?
Hand over the pie ingredients to Enite?
Give
Don’t give
Sure thing! What do you need?
Could you get me [em1]3 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "SilverStarFlower_Name"))][/em1] and [em1]2 birdflowers[/em1]?
No problem. I’ll be back in a jiffy.
Thank you, dearie.
Sorry, I’ve got things to do at the moment.
Oh, I guess it can’t be helped then. Try not to push yourself too hard.
I’ve got the pie ingredients!
The ingredients are in excellent condition.
Wait just a moment, dearie.
It's done. Take this with you.
Wow. It looks delicious.
The peaches are ripe. Enjoy it.
It looks so delicious. Thanks for the food.
And take one of these too.
Okay, sure.
Did you meet [em1]Rosie[/em1]in the forest?
No, I haven’t.
It’s the one who likes fishing, right?
Yeah, it’s that kid.
Since kids are often picky eaters, I’m concerned about Rosie.
Please give some of this pie to [em1]Rosie[/em1].
It seems like Rosie is always eating fish whenever I see her.
Rubrum also struggled, trying to drink only sweet tea rather than having a meal.
I'm worried that she might be skipping meals. Bring this to Rosie.
Give the bait back to Rosie?
Return it
Don't return it
Can you get my bait for me?
Oh, I guess it can’t be helped if you’re busy.
It’s not budging an inch.
Should I throw a potion or something?
It probably won’t work. It seems to be protected by something.
Oh my.
Oh, it’s working. It’s opening.
Alright, let’s go in.
Why are there so many things blocking the path?
This must be a forest with many secrets.
Looks like a barrier made with a [em1]witch pattern[/em1].
Witch pattern? Is there a witch here?
There was or...
Do you know how it works?
School hammered it into my head. Shouldn’t be an issue, long as it’s drawn well.
Virgil, look at that!
It’s grown so much.
It wasn’t that big a while ago.
That must be an adult honey pumpkin.
We better get rid of it before it grows any more.
We must get rid of it to get to a new place, since we haven't been behind there.
What? I’m not even a gardener. Why...?
Oh, I guess it can’t be helped to get to the new place.
I guess I should make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))][/em1].
Don’t forget to remove the [em1]nucleus[/em1] if you want to avoid repeating the same thing.
It's simple because I've made it once before.
Let’s go to the new place now.
Before that...
You've been staring at my feet for a while, is there some kind of problem?
Oh, I was going to ask anyway. Isn't it uncomfortable to wear such strappy boots?
It takes some time to put them on and take them off but I'm used to it.
Then it would be hard for you when you arrive at Highlion.
What? What are you talking about...?
I mean, you have to take your shoes off when you get off.
Oh, you were kidding? I'm sorry, I'm rather dull when it comes to things like this...
<shake>Jenny!!!!</shake>
<shake>Mr. Bartender!!!</shake>
The mystery has been solved.
Did I make some kind of mistake?
No, no... I just realized that I was deceived.
Come to think of it, I remember now. It's a joke to make fun of people who visit Highlion for the firs time...
Stop. You don't have to kill me twice by giving that much detail.
I’m sorry.
Are you holding back laughter?
...No, I’m not.
He’s trying so hard to be considerate of you. Don’t ask twice.
Virgil, I hate you even more now.
You don't need to be too upset.
When I went there for the first time in the past, I was also tricked by a colleague and took them off.
That doesn't comfort me at all.
How do you feel?
Why are you asking me that?
Your molars might fall out. Relax a bit and tell me.
I can't believe Jenny deceived me...
There's a reason why she's your friend.
Now, go back to your seat quietly and wait until we've arrived.
We still have to three more days to go.
Three more days... that's as terrible as the smell of spotted shitake mushrooms.
We don’t check the passengers’ outfit.
Even if you don't check, it's incovenient to get off if you wear strappy boots.
There are so many different types of clothing that cause discomfort, I can't define them all.
Then, what about having a hard time taking off your shoes when you get off?
Delays occur once in a while due to their shoes, but again, it’s not regulated.
I guess there's no fine.
Isn't it a matter of harming social reputation rather than the fine?
Is that so?
The food was really delicious though.
You face was bright only when you were eating after getting on the train.
The omelette that was overflowing with cheese and crab meat as soon as it was cut...
The pink salmon steak seasoned with fresh lemon-scented kiwi sauce...
Even the slightly frozen strawberries and peach sorbet with whipped cream...!
Without this meal, I would have jumped off the train sooner.
It's definitely different from the food you buy at the store at the School for Witches.
I ate that to collect the great witch series cards.
I got scolded because I was caught keeping the card and throwing away the bread.
Don’t do that again in Highlion.
I’ll definitely try the Nubicula cupcakes there!
That’s if I get to Highlion before I get bored to death.
It's the only pleasure on this train.
Wine in a place like this must be expensive, right?
I don't want to talk about Sally's moonshine again.
I guess so. It's not like you can buy it just because you want to.
Is it delicious? I think Twinkle-Twinkle Juice would taste much better.
Aria said, you don't drink for the taste.
Sally also said that.
It was fun to help make Sally’s moonshine.
Why the heck would anyone put that in a drink?
That’s the reason it was fun, although I didn't drink it because it looked too dangerous.
It was a situation that I never want to be put through again.
Was it that bad?
It's a familiar face.
Did you know that this witch was the one who first proposed this train?
I know. And this isn't a school, Mr. Virgil.
It was always her name that came up first when memorizing names of witches who had great achievements.
You mean that weird song.
I made it as part of an exam strategy.
I sang it in my head when I was taking a history exam.
And I’m seeing her again in the train.
I still like this witch.
“O Witch, help those in your reach.”
It’s a famous saying.
This is...
a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))]!
I even went to a hidden library because I wanted to make it.
I'm so lucky to find this here!
They don’t normally use a skeleton design as a symbol of luck, right?
The important thing now is that I have something to blow things up with.
And also something to blow up.
You’re super excited.
Then shall we go try it right away?
I should ask the person closest to me before going further.
Over there, I think someone came.
Wow. You're right.
Woohoo! The [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonTear_Name"))] is ready!
Now all I have to do is remove the nucleus.
Now I must find the nucleus.
Ready?
Alright, now I also removed the bird cage that was protecting the nucleus.
I missed this feeling.
Do you plan to destroy everything on the top of getting into trouble?
Hey! What do you take me for?
[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))]... Don’t you feel the almighty power just from the name?
When in trouble, throw it!
Break it if you can’t have it?
Sometimes it takes boldness to overcome a crisis!
Don't you think it's strange that a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))] was dropped in that secluded forest?
Someone might have hidden it thinking that it's treasure like Rubrum.
Go! [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))]!
Or someone might have spilled it.
The [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))]?
Ugh, I don't know. The important thing now is that the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BoomPotion_Name"))] is in my hands.
How about changing the [em1]Roaster[/em1] for a better one for [em1]15 Gold Coins[/em1]?
Thanks. The delivery fairies have probably finished the delivery. You can go back and check.
Let me know if you’re interested.
An affordable Roaster of <노란 풍차>! It will save you twice as much time.
It can process larger quantities at once.
Did you say delivery fairy? Is there a thing like that?
Don't worry, because we’re offering wages and welfare to everyone under a proper contract.
Here’s the delivery agency name.
We accept retail sale of potions everyday. Use if you need gold coins.
How about changing the [em1]Extractor[/em1] for a better one for [em1]10 Gold Coins[/em1]?
An affordable Extractor of <노란 풍차>! It will save you twice as much time.
Thank goodness gracious.
I was just thinking about how nice it would be if a witch were to pass by.
There is a scholar who is kinda weird among the acquaintances I’ve known for a long time.
Recently, he was fascinated by the research of unusual animals and plants.
It seems that he also became interested in the green forest after that.
Ellie, as you know, entering this village was troublesome until only recently, right?
But tada... A witch who solved the problem showed up.
Hmm... I feel awkward.
But the corner of your mouth is pointing toward the sky.
That guy said that the effects on nature from potions made by a witch is very special.
That's why he wants to get information on such a specific phenomenon.
I’m the broker so naturally, I'll pay for it.
How does that sound? Are you interested?
There is a frog that only shows up in very secluded places.
Catch me some frogs and bring me some information on it as well.
I'll add the value of the catch as well as information gathered as a bonus.
Really? I’m sorry to hear that. Let’ me know if you change your mind.
Set purchase by reservation
#N/A
There is a scholar who wants to get specific information related to it.
They say that the effects on nature from a potion made by a witch is very special.
Should I give her my catch and information gathered?
I brought the frog collection here.
Did you find out about the frog?
I look forward to your catch and valuable information.
So how was it?
Uh... I just caught them.
No, I also need more detailed information.
I look forward to it.
It looks interesting. How was the frog?
It floated up when I threw the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "WeightLossPotion_Name"))].
I guess it’s very light.
So does it go into the shadows?
I guess it was true that there are many interesting creatures in the forest.
Thanks to you, I also found out something interesting.
Good job. This is the reward.
[em1]25 Gold Coins.[/em1] I counted correctly.
Did you see that?! Virgil?
The frog started floating. That's so fun!
It looks just like a balloon.
Now I can just collect it and tell Aurea.
This witch pattern seems to have been erased a bit.
It won’t work if it gets erased like this.
You can draw the pattern again using the [em1]same colored witch chalk[/em1].
Since I have the one I just picked up earlier, let's draw it again with that.
I don’t have the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestCoreKey_Name"))][/em1].
I don’t have the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestDoorBKey_Name"))][/em1].
I don’t have the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestDoorAKey_Name"))][/em1].
I don’t have the witch chalk of that color.
Should I draw the witch pattern again using 1 [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestCoreKey_Name"))][/em1]? 
Should I draw the witch pattern again using 1 [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestDoorBKey_Name"))][/em1]?
Should I draw the witch pattern again using 1 [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "GreenForestDoorAKey_Name"))][/em1]?
Alright, I drew the witch pattern again.
Let’s think it over a bit more.
I think the cat dropped something and left. What’s this?
Looks like a [em1]witch chalk[/em1].
That thing you use to draw things like a pattern?
It looks a little different from the one we were using at school...
It's just a different packaging.
Take a look at that huge prickly vine.
I think something fell off earlier.
I think I can push the rock since it’s downhill.
But I think the rock still needs to be a little [em1]lighter[/em1].
I have a product to recommend today. How does that sound?
What kind?
A good machinine tool came out and I thought I'd introduce it to you.
This time, an affordable product came out from <노란 풍차>.
They say it was made to [em1]process larger quantities at once[/em1] by increasing the space of the collection.
I also have the Roaster.
So we don’t have to do it one at a time now?
If you buy this machine tool, yes.
We will cut your time in half. The new Extractor by <노란 풍차>
The Extractor is 10 Gold Coins and the Roaster is 15 Gold Coins.
The advertising text is pretty cool too.
Shall I read a book?
(There is a scene where the demon king attacks the human world. The demon king kidnaps the princess.)
(Our hero, Don Julius, meets a companion while on a quest to save the princess.)
(In the end, Don Julius defeats the demon king. Peace was brought the world.)
That’s a wonderful story.
Isn't that just a murder case?
When I read it again, the princess story disappeared from the middle.
Maybe the princess fell in love with the demon king.
They probably couldn't possibly write that story in the book.
Or maybe the co-worker who joined in the middle was a princess?
That’s also interesting.
(There is a story of a man who loves Jane.)
(But Jane didn’t love anyone. She just wanted to be free.)
(Jane finally realizes her feelings only after the man dies.)
That’s such a sad story.
Sounds like a horror novel.
It’s so sad even after reading again.
It’s even more scary to see it again.
Pietro was a shoe shiner.
Pietro, who received a great reward from a fairy, lived happily for the rest of his life.
What's the lesson?
The service industry is hard?
After reading it again, there are no conditions for how the fairy wins the bet.
His shoe polishing skill was so good that people even came from neighboring villages.
When word of the shoe shiner reached a nearby fairy’s ears, it couldn’t resist.
The fairy went to Pietro and said...
"Can you make any pair of shoes sparkle and shine beautifully?"
"I can."
“Polish the next three customer’s shoes to perfection, and you’ll get one wish.”
“Okay."
Then the fairy poured water on the main road in the village without Pietro knowing and made it muddy. 
The first customer came in wearing shoes that was muddy from stepping on the mud.
Pietro skillfully brushed off the mud with a brush and shined the shoes by applying shoe polish.
The shoes became clean and shiny instantly. The first customer was satisfied and left.
This time, the fairy made the sun hot. 
The second customer's shoes were full of mud that hardened like stone because of the sun.
Pietro smashed the mud with a hammer and grinded down the rest with sandpaper.
After shining them, the shoes sparkled even more than before. The customer was satisfied and left.
The fairy, who was so annoyed, turned into a beggar this time and went to see Pietro.
Pietro was surprised as he was looking at the third customer’s shoes.
Looking closely, what he thought were muddy shoes, was just feet covered in a lot of of mud.
Pietro, after much thought, baked the mud into pottery.
Glazing the pottery made it shine brighter than any other shoe.
The fairy even forgot about the bet and enjoyed looking at his beautiful shoes.
If you work hard, good luck will come.
What would the fairy have taken if Pietro lost?
Isn't it usually the wrist here?
Oh, Virgil! That’s gross.
Let’s focus on what we’re doing now.
I saw a moving flower in the forest.
A moving flower?
Ellie, do you like tea?
Yeah, I like it.
Woah, let’s drink some tea later.
I’ll give you some delicious tea.
No, I don’t like it that much.
Really? There's also delicious tea.
I’ll give you some delicious tea. Let’s drink it together next time.
No, it was a flower. It swayed even when there was no wind.
Huh? Where did you see it?
I saw it near the lake.
Thanks, I’ll go there later.
Ellie, have you ever picked an apple from the bush?
Yes, I have.
Was it delicious?
Yes, it was delicious.
It’s delicious, right? I like it too.
But you shouldn’t eat too much. Grandma said you’ll get a stomachache.
Here, have a taste. It’s delicious.
It’s just bitter and I don't know what it tastes like.
It's fun to play with Ellie.
I feel good today for some reason.
My name is Rubrum.
I like Uncle Arden's [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BeefBread_Name"))]. It’s delicious.
But grandma doesn't let me eat a lot of [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BeefBread_Name"))].
It’s fun to make tea.
It's the name given to me by my grandma.
The name suits you well.
I still don’t like bitter ones.
Ellie, what kind of tea do you like?
Sweet tea
Aromatic tea
Bitter tea
Don’t like tea
I like sweet tea.
I like tea that has a fragrant aroma.
I like tea that is slightly bitter.
I don’t like tea that much.
Bitter ones don’t taste good.
Bitter ones are also delicious.
No, the bitter ones taste bad.
I guess you'll like the bitter grape tea that grandma likes then.
Bird flower tea is a nice armomatic one.
Oh, I think it will smell good indeed.
I also like sweet tea.
I like bush apple tea and [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "WitchFlower_Name"))] tea as well.
But you shouldn’t drink too much sweet tea. They say it will rot your teeth.
Okay. I’ll be careful.
There are so many delicious teas.
Let's drink some tea together next time. I'll give you some delicious tea.
Oh, okay. Thanks.
I like playing in the forest.
But you must be careful when you play in the forest.
Because you might end up like this again.
Because you might end up like last time.
Hehe...
I don’t know anything more.
Do you want to hear about the delicious tea in the forest again?
No, that’s okay.
I don’t know anything other than that.
The prickly vine in the village is not so good.
Not so good?
It’s bitter, spicy and [em1]not tasty[/em1]. It also smells fishy.
You ate it?
Yes, I drank it by drawing it as tea.
I dried and roasted by picking only thorns, and it was hard.
Oh, I remembered. It tasted similar to [em1]that thing[/em1].
I guess you drink everything as tea.
It also tasted similar to [em1]White Prickly Vine[/em1] and [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] in the forest.
Hmm, if it [em1]tastes similar[/em1], can you see it as [em1]similar breed[/em1]?
Thanks anyway. It was helpful.
There are so many delicious tea ingredients in the forest.
I like apple bush because it’s sweet. Grandma says the bird flower tea smells good.
I’ll also make some delicious tea for you, Ellie.
Okay, I’ll look forward to it.
I guess you also tried drinking all of them.
White Prickly Vine has a good scent.
Alright, come over for some tea next time.
Arden’s soup must taste good.
I didn’t gain weight!
This witch's house is too old to begin with!
I guess so.
I should repair the house.
You’re thinking like that only after you broke the floor.
I should tell Diane, right?
Wouldn't it become official once you tell Diane?
It’s an execution of budget.
She’ll upload a document and a witch will come.
And they’ll also find out that the master witch is not here.
Then what should I do?
The witch's house can also be fixed by a skillful artisan.
Then I should ask Kyla.
I mean once I get out of here.
Isn’t it too squeaky?
Did you gain weight?
Hey! That’s not it!
Good, I got out somehow.
Isn’t this bad?
There's a huge hole there, though.
Let’s ask Kyla or someone else.
"12 Plants That Changed the History of Witches"
Garlic: Delicious
"Fun Witch Plant Book"
Goblin Cup: A shiny, black cup-shaped mushroom. Drink the dew for eternal sleep.
"Dream Plants for Witch Garden"
White Prickly Vine: Only moonlight kills this prickly vine. Perfect for fences.
What brings you here?
Just tell me comfortably.
I guess you have time for a chat.
You seem to have a lot of questions about me.
I don't sell anything.
I don’t think I know about that.
I guess it was true...
Although it still remains elsewhere, I’m here now.
I’ll get rid of all the prickly vines and bring the villagers back again.
Ellie, you’re so reliable.
I’ve already brought Kyla.
I want to see a noisy village with everyone gathered together soon.
I hope so. I’m also looking forward to it.
So, since you answered all my questions so well, I should give you a prize, right?
Tada, I’ll give you some candy.
Wow. It looks delicious!
Eat carefully.
Okay! I’ll enjoy it.
I'm going to leave now!
Are you going to leave right away?
Yes, I also have to go somewhere else...
I've heard everything that I need from here.
Oh, and the master witch knows, but let me know of changes in villager numbers.
I’ll leave my office address.
See you next time. Ellie Blueriver.
Good bye.
I removed the prickly vines around here.
Already? But I don’t think you asked that many questions...
You’ve answered all the important questions well. So as a prize...
I’ll give you one more candy, since you’ve answered all of my questions [em1]without any mistakes[/em1].
Wow, thank you!
The vanished master witch...Prickly vines and only 4 people in the village...
And Blueriver...
It would be fun.
Look at this, Virgil! I got candy too.
Ellie, don’t eat that.
Oh, why? I got this as a prize.
Didn’t you see his face just now?
No one has ever looked that suspicious.
Virgil, it’s a bad thing to judge people by their faces.
It’s okay to judge someone with that kind of face.
And, you also thought he was suspicious at first.
This is this and that’s that.
Anyway, be careful.
He seemed like a nice guy. Don't sweat it.
By the way, what is that exchange department or whatever? Does it really exist?
Mutual Information Exchange Department between Witch and Human.
It really does exist. There were some difficulties, but it's running fine now.
What kind of place is it?
It’s a place created to share collected information with human beings.
These days, it seems to be focused on the [em1]census[/em1] of the village managed by a witch's house.
Hmm, so it wasn’t a strange place.
The strange thing is the people, not the department.
Witches naturally collect information because of the witch's house.
Let’s bring back the villagers first.
We'll meet Kent again anyway.
By the way, is Kent really from there?
You answered everything without even checking on that?
You saw the [em1]moon-shaped brooch[/em1] on the cloak, didn’t you? It also serves as a witch society pass.
I didn’t know that.
His [em1]red jeweled necklace[/em1] is the [em1]royal seal[/em1] of the human society.
Does that mean he is [em1]royal blood[/em1]?
Could be, but from the looks of it he’s just a [em1]public official[/em1].
I mean, because people who work for the royal family also have them.
Well anyway, that means it's not a lie.
He didn’t look like someone who would lie either.
Indeed, Blueriver... It's going the way I thought it would.
So I guess I'll become a little busy now.
See? He’s a nice guy.
What on earth makes you think so? He seemed to be up to something.
Prejudice is not a good thing, Virgil.
You're just happy because you got candy.
The candy is just something extra!
He said he’ll even find out about the witch who was there in the past.
Should be easy for him, considering the amount of info they get there.
Right? We just need to focus on restoring the village!
Heh, you're a witch.
Yes, I’m Ellie, an apprentice witch.
I'm [em1]Arden[/em1], a [em1]dragon[/em1] and a [em1]cook[/em1].
Did you help Rubrum? You’re pretty kind.
Don’t mention it.
I think I'll end up doing so.
It's kind of weird to call it a reward, but tell me if you're hungry.
Although it's usually not for free...
This is for helping Rubrum.
Take it since it's free.
It’s the last one remaining.
... Why are you staring at me like that?
Ah, I'm sorry. It's my first time seeing a dragon with my own eyes.
Normally you wouldn’t see one.
Even mom said that she seldom met a dragon.
That's why I wasn't sure... but you're a real dragon.
I never thought I would meet a chef dragon in a place like this.
Since dragons have no reason to mingle with humans...
I think I was like that too.
I can't tell you the reason even if you look at me with those eyes.
Because I don’t remember now.
The witch from before... What kind of witch was Liza?
She probably wasn’t a bad witch.
Is that all?
She was kind and quiet. She listened to almost everything people had to say.
She didn’t come out to the village often. It seemed like she was usually doing something at home.
You don’t know what she’s doing in the house?
I don’t know.
I told you. Liza was quiet.
Alright. Let me know if you think of something.
I don’t know anything.
Ask someone else.
The prickly vines of the village?
Yes, just in case you know something.
Well, I don't know much about the prickly vine.
I just feel the [em1]malice[/em1] filled in it.
[em1]Malice[/em1]?
[em1]The prickly vines that only destroys houses[/em1]? It's so unnatural.
If it’s not someone’s [em1]malice[/em1], what would it be?
Is there someone who would do such a terrible thing?
I don't know. Well...
Heh, I’m not sure. I don't know anything.
How about searching through the [em1]witch's house[/em1] at least?
Oh, and on the way to the witch's house, please do me a [em1]favor[/em1].
I lost a [em1]bag containing an important ingredient[/em1].
I think I lost it somewhere [em1]near the water[/em1]. Please try to find it for me.
Okay, I’ll try to find it.
I’ve already searched for it.
What did you find?
I found a thick plant research book.
From what I’ve seen, the village’s prickly vines are an [em1]amalgamation[/em1] of plants.
Then, I guess all you have to do now is, figure out which plants have been combined.
Yes, that’s why I’m going around asking the villagers.
[em1]Enite[/em1] or [em1]Rubrum[/em1] should know something.
Since they should be familiar with plants.
Why don't you help me look for something since you’re here?
I remember carrying it into the village.
Oh, I picked up a bag next to that river. Is this the one by any chance?
Oh, that’s the one.
Then do it when you're free.
Oh, that’s the one. Take this.
I was looking for it. Good. Here, take this.
Hey you. Did you promise to get rid of these prickly vines?
But will you be able to do it?
Of course. I’ll bring the village back to its former appearance.
That's some confidence.
The [em1]burned box[/em1] in the village. Was it Arden?
How’d that happen?
I was lighting the candle with my breath...
...but a [em1]cough[/em1] came over me.
And that was that.
Why don’t you just use a [em1]match[/em1]?
How do you expect me to use such a tiny thing?
All I have to do is just breathe on them.
You’ll burn down every box in this village at this rate.
I’ll be fine if I’m careful.
Come to think of it, can’t you just breathe fire into the streetlamp and light it?
I’m sure I could.
Then it’s settled then!
But there’s nothing to burn in the streetlamp.
There’s a small glass bottle inside taking up space, so using [em1]Firewood[/em1] is out of the option.
That was the plan.
But the streetlamp would melt away if [em1]Hot Flames[/em1] were placed in it.
You need [em1]Cold Flames[/em1] for that.
[em1]Cold Flames[/em1] that don’t require fuel...
Why, do you think you're up for the task?
This is quite the dilemma.
Yeah, before you end up burning down every single box in this village.
Alright, go give it a shot.
Now, what to do...
Dunno. Hmm... [em1]Cold Flames[/em1]...
How about we use [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SunlightPotion_Name"))][/em1]?
Light that bright would end up blinding you.
Something softer... with a pretty color... <bounce>That’s it!</bounce>
<rainb>Twinkle-Twinkle Juice!</rainb>
Oh, it's not everyday that you get a good idea...
I need the [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice recipe[/em1].
[em1]<wave>For the sake of this village</wave>[/em1]!
Oh please, you just want to drink that [em1]junk[/em1].
It has a [em1]soft glow[/em1], it’s [em1]cool to the touch[/em1], it’s perfect! Sure it tastes kinda [em1]sweet[/em1], but that’s just a bonus.
Tell me about it.
Alright, let’s go look for the [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice recipe[/em1].
You'll find it inside the [em1]Witches Catalogue[/em1].
I’m not feeling too excited about this, though.
[em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1] should do the trick!
Alright, let’s get to it.
I thought we’d need it, so I made one in advance!
Yeah, well...
Alright, let’s give [em1]Enite[/em1] the [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1].
You could always [em1]change the color[/em1] at the very least...
Good idea.
What color should it be?
It’s the village’s streetlamp, so go ask the villagers.
Alright! Let’s decide after asking them [em1]their favorite colors[/em1].
Do you have a color that you like, Arden?
I don’t really mind either way, but if I had to choose, it’d be [em1]silver[/em1].
[em1]Silver[/em1]
I’m surprised it’s not gold.
Gold is good, too.
Black, like pepper, is also fine.
But [em1]silver[/em1] is better.
Why do you like the color silver so much?
Not too sure. Can’t remember. But why the questions about color?
I’m asking around to decide the color of the light coming from the streetlamp.
I like the color silver, but the streetlamp can glow in any color for all I care.
This [em1]box[/em1] looks pretty useful.
I can put stuff in here when my pockets are full.
This is such a quiet place.
Hello. Are you Ellie Blueriver?
Yes, I’m Ellie Blueriver.
My name is Kent, I work for the [em1]Witch Human Information Exchange Department[/em1].
I think it’s my first time hearing of such a department...
It’s a department created by witches to provide information that they find useful to humans.
It's been quite a while since was created, but since you haven't heard of it, are you an apprentice witch?
Uh... Yeah. I came here recently.
No, I'm not.
You registered with the Witches' Catalogue as Ellie Blueriver recently, right?
Uh... Yes, that’s right.
Then, where is Ellie Blueriver?
Actually, I’m Ellie Blueriver.
So why did you lie?
Because you looked suspicious, I just...
I’m not a suspicious person.
So, then...
Ellie, who are you talking to again?
Oh, that... witch or whatever from the exchange department.
Is that a talking hat?
<shake>Oh, the m... master witch</shake> is not here right now. She’s talking through the hat.
The master witch is not here...
Because she’s busy. <shake>Haha...</shake>
If he’s from the exchange department, it must be because of the villagers.
Villagers?
Yes, that's right.
The master witch seems to know well about us.
I know a little bit.
Since I left everything related to the witch's house to Ellie, you can talk to her.
Right, I'm in charge of the witch's house now.
Alright, got it. I’ll do that for today.
But what will we be talking about?
Don’t worry, I will only ask simple questions.
If you answer well, there is even a [em1]prize[/em1].
Wow, a prize?
What is the [em1]name of the village[/em1] that the witch's house you’re currently staying at is in charge of?
It’s Wisteria.
Then, [em1]how many[/em1] villagers are living in Wisteria at this time?
Uh... Hmm, just a minute.
Oh, there are 4. Four people are living there now.
4 people.
... Did you say [em1]4 people[/em1]?
Yes, Enite, Rubrum, Arden, and Kyla, who moved here recently.
According to this data that I have, Wisteria used to be a village where [em1]20 people[/em1] lived in [em1]7 years ago[/em1]...
Can I go to the village for a minute and take a look?
Of course. I’ll guide you.
You are reliable.
Since I'm in charge of the witch's house, leave everything to me.
That’s...
They say a prickly vine that was destroying houses suddenly appeared in the village few years ago.
So many villagers left that there are only a few people remaining.
2 people
3 people
4 people
5 people
It’s 2 people.
It’s 3 people.
It’s 5 people.
Wake up, Ellie. It’s 4 people.
The prickly vines destroying houses...
Oh, that’s probably right too.
You registered the Witches' Catalogue not too long ago, right?
Yes... But why?
But what kind of question?
You don’t need to worry, since they’re formal and trivial questions.
I see... Wisteria.
Oh, it’s here.
Bimbley
Vine Deli
Yegrina
This is Bimbley.
This is Vine Deli.
This is Yegrina.
Ellie, didn’t you see the sign? This village is [em1]Wisteria[/em1].
Oh, right. It’s Wisteria.
Hello! Kent, long time no see.
Is the master witch still not here today?
Huh? Yes...! That’s right. Since she’s a busy person... Haha...
It was a joke. You don't have to hide anymore.
It's been a while, Ellie Blueriver.
I’m not sure what you’re talking about...!
I knew that the master witch was not here for some reason.
Actually...
Looks like someone new has moved into the village.
I’m also relieved to see the village being restored smoothly.
Oh, oh, no! She’s here!
I also know that you actually have to go to the witch's house in Highlion, Ellie.
Ugh
Don’t worry. I’m just curious.
I wonder what happened.
Please tell me. I will keep it a secret.
... You’ll really keep it a secret?
Yes, he’s a villager who was originally living here.
What’s his name?
His name is Roy. He’s running a flower shop.
Is he living alone?
I see... Alright, got it.
So that's what happened...
You seem to empathize with the village, Ellie.
I just did as I was taught.
But, I’m worried...
If you didn’t go to Highlion, wouldn’t they be waiting for you at the witch's house in Highlion, Ellie?
Everything may seem fine, but the School for Witches and Highlion will find out.
When that happens...*Giggle*
Oh, I’m sorry. It reminds me of something from the past...
What should I do?... What if the teacher finds out?
I mean I’d really be in big trouble if mom found out...
That would be really a big problem.
But, don’t worry too much.
I think I should worry considering Aria’s personality.
Even though Ellie is staying here with good intentions of helping the village...
I understand, but it probably won't become known so soon.
I understand that the school for witches does not send apprentice witches to a witch's house.
That’s why neither place will think anything is wrong despite your abscence.
Then,that won't be problem anymore. Thank God.
And um...
Is there something else...?
Um... No, not really.
Then, I have something I want to ask you, is that ok?
Of course. You’re free to ask whatever, Ellie.
I want to know what kind of person the witch who was originally at the witch's house is and where she went.
I think it has something to do with the village, and probably with the prickly vines also...
Can you help me?
I don't know anything right now. So, I'll investigate and let you know next time I come.
I’ll leave it to you then.
You’ll keep it a secret, right?
I can’t leave this place behind now.
Of course. I made a promise with you, Ellie.
Only if there are no special conditions.
I'll head back now.
Alright, see you next time.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Tada! Here is an award for the hard work.
Okay! I’ll appreciate it.
I'm really going to go now!
Do you hate witches?
I have bad memories.
Didn’t the witch at the witch’s house help?
I think I've received help from her many times.
Then those are good memories.
Hmm...
I still don’t like them though.
I'm a [em1]dragon[/em1].
I'm also a [em1]cook[/em1].
I wouldn't have known if you didn’t tell me.
Then, what more do you want to know?
Well, [em1]why[/em1] is a dragon working as a cook?
Hmm, well...
I forgot.
How can you forget that?
I guess it wasn’t so important.
That doesn’t seem so.
How would you know when even I forgot?
Because you're a [em1]dragon[/em1].
And also a [em1]cook[/em1].
Well, of course.
The problem is that you [em1]forgot[/em1].
Do you know about dragons?
I know as much as what I learned from school.
I didn’t study any further.
What do you know?
That they live a thousand years as giant lizards that breathe fire from their mouths.
You know a lot.
Isn't that right? I was quite the honor student.
But you don’t know anything...
What do you mean?
A dragon doesn’t live a thousand years.
But isn't it called a thousand-year dragon because it lives for a thousand years?
We don't live one particular life for a thousand years.
It lives many lives.
What’s the difference?
Figure it out yourself.
My throat feels dry.
Then, what about me? I’m also a [em1]witch[/em1].
Come to think of it, I guess you are.
You don't like me?
I can't say whether I like you or not.
It hasn’t been long since I first met you.
It depends on what you do.
Um.
You can breathe out fire, right?
Wow, I envy you. I'm most envious of you being able to breathe out fire and fly in the sky.
Breathing out fire is convenient when you cook.
But your throat becomes dry.
Flying is not very good for your back either.
I didn't want to hear such realistic things.
Then what do you want to do if you can breathe out fire and fly?
First, I’ll fly around while breathing out fire.
You sure are using it to the fullest.
I’m not sure...
Hello, Ellie. I have something I want to show you.
I made a very huge castle.
I'll show you, Ellie...
Oh, that’s right!
Did you make it with Kyla’s shovel?
Yeah... it was good for scooping up a lot of sand since it was big.
Now I have to run an errand for grandma. What should I do?
Where did you make it? I’ll go get it on my way to see the castle.
It's the place with the well, just leave the village and keep going straight!
You can also play rock-paper-scissors on the stairs.
You can pick apples too since there are apple bushes around.
It's my favorite playground.
Where did you say you were playing at?
The place with stairs after you keep going straight out of the village!
I had some kind of [em1]weird dream[/em1]. I’m sure.
You’ve been saying that for the past few days.
What kind of dream was it?
That’s the problem.
I don’t remember what the dream was.
It's must be an ordinary silly dream.
No! I mean something’s strange.
Isn't it because the bed has changed?
Something... Something feels strange.
Maybe so. But I’m getting some kind of [em1]feeling that its important[/em1].
I should try asking other people too.
Hello. Where am I?
Since it’s cumbersome to explain one by one, I won't. You'll forget it anyway.
Look, I'm sorry, but I really don't know what you're talking about at all.
It’s truly amazing that your reaction is different every time even though you can't remember.
Uh, I’ll probably remember this one.
I came in after drinking [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))].
It felt like I kept having weird dreams, so I drank it beforehand.
Wait wait, you drank what?
Is this the weird dream I've been having?
Okay. Good. I’ll do it again.
Nice to meet you, girl.
Are you the apprentice witch Ellie Blueriver?
Uh, do I remember anything?
You're only doing this now?
You couldn’t remember even if I begged you until now...
I'm not sure what's going on, but don't worry. I'll remember everything from now on.
Please tell me now.
My dignity as a god...
Who you are, and why did you appear in my dream.
Yes... okay. I’ll tell you.
Thank you so much for saving Rubrum. You did a great job removing the White Prickly Vine.
You also did well by promising to reconstruct the village and bringing in the first villager Kyla the carpenter.
You also found the prickly vine nucleus well. Now all you have to do is make [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))] one more time.
Why did the first meeting that must be dignified become like this...?
Still, it's been a while since I talked about this.
Yes, I called you to this village.
And missed the train because I overslept...
Yes, you missed the train because I made you ‘accidentally’ oversleep.
You... did?
Even if it wasn't for the dream, we met once before.
Ah, no way. The cat that was on the lake shore...
I guided you to this witch's house.
And I showed up in your dreams so that you'd overslept and missed the train.
I wanted to help this village which became scattered by the prickly vines.
The witch didn’t come to the witch's house anymore that now abandoned.
Let me repeat what I said in the dream that night.
Ellie, please help this village.
No thanks.
You’ve aided a village, it’s people, and a God, none of whom you’ve met before.
Good. You’re still doing so.
Even back then, when I didn't know about Rubrum, Enite, Arden, or the village at all.
I am the white cat god, the guardian deity of this village.
Ellie, I called you to this village because I have a favor to ask you.
But, what is the favor that you’re trying to ask me by doing so?
Why did you do that? Why did you say you’ll help me without hesitation?
Happiness
Obligation
Fun
Graduation
I wish other people around me become happy.
If people become happy, I also become happy.
When I help someone, I don't need to choose who to help.
I want to help people that are closest to me and those in need of help.
A shining tree in the mountain! Prickly vines all over! Rare plants and animals!
For me, staying in this village seemed much more fun than Highlion.
And, there are many in Highlion other than myself who can help.
If anyone is unhappy, I want to make them happy.
Because that’s what makes me happy.
I have heard this more than enough at school.
I grew up always listening to the story of my mom’s adventure.
I really wanted to go on that kind of adventure some day.
I want to become a true witch like my parents.
In order to do so, I have to finish my apprenticeship first and graduate the School for Witches.
In order to finish my apprenticeship, I must help many people at the witch's house.
This village is full of people who need help.
I'm glad it was you on the train back then, Ellie.
Any witch would have done what I did.
No, Ellie. Absolutely not!
This is a very personal and selfish request.
But a god without believers is powerless. I couldn't do it with my own power.
You’re the only one that I can ask, Ellie.
I'm so glad it's you. Thanks again.
It’s not such a big deal either.
Oh, come to think of it...
Yes? Do you have any questions?
Perhaps the fact that I felt like I’ve been there when I first entered the village was also...
Yes, there was a time when I showed you the village in the dream. Although you didn’t remember...
And was that the also the reason I felt as if I knew Enite?
I really talked a lot about Enite.
I’ve been watching Enite since she was born until now.
Enite was a real cutie as a child, you know? She was so bold and articulate...
Oh, look at the time.
What's the time?
Time to get up.
Since I’m always here, you can come meet me anytime.
Since you won’t remember otherwise, now I’ll appear only after you’ve had [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))].
Okay, I’ll come here again if I have something to say.
Okay, thank you. I look forward to your support in the future, Ellie.
Me too, White Cat God.
God? A god called me to this place?
I see. No wonder I overslept.
Precisely. You reacted the same way the first time we met in your sleep.
You should wake up from the dream when it's morning.
But as I was on the train, I accidentally...
Yes, the train stopped because the prickly vine grew by chance.
Ellie, you really never change.
You’ve always playfully accepted requests that you can say no to.
Just like in today's dream, where I even forgot to count how many times.
Jokingly refusing just to see my reaction... Just like the first night we met.
I guess you experienced it already.
Virgil!
Hold on, let me guess.
Huh? Guess what?
Did a Goddess dressed in white come to tell you how you’re the chosen warrior?
Uh, kinda...
So original...
But Virgil, this is different.
Different as in, the main character is a bit lacking in some aspects?
This is my story.
It’s not about some chosen warrior from your typical fairy tale.
And so you’ve decided to be the heroine of this tale as old as time?
It’s so I can make everyone happy.
“O Witch, help those in your reach,” is how it goes, right?
After all, the heroine always goes on fun adventures.
It’s so that I can graduate from school and become a true witch.
Rubrum?
Hey Ellie!
Let me try guessing this time.
Roy’s house is complete, right?
How did you know?
Because Rubrum came to pick me up like this last time, too.
Teehee, exactly. Let’s hurry up and go, Ellie!
Welcome, Ellie.
Wow...! I love the scent of the flowers!
Inside, it's still unorganized and messy but...
I put the belongings I brought outside for now.
I'm glad you like it.
The witch helped me a lot once again.
You can thank me later. Hahaha!
Hello, Roy. My name is Ellie.
Yes, nice to meet you. I heard about you from Enite.
You helped to get rid of the prickly vines in the village and restore the house.
Thank you. I owe you one.
It was nothing.
Me too! Me too! I helped too.
Thank you as well, Rubrum.
Hehe.
When Kyla returned, it felt like a dream.
But now, Roy is back, too.
It made me feel excited again to see Kyla building Roy’s house.
Everyone really gave their all this time, too.
Ellie, here! Let's pop this together!
Oh.
Ah.
It’s the person we saw in the train...!
I thought you were going to Highlion... This is an unexpected reunion.
Yes. How fascinating.
Hmm... I suppose I should introduce myself properly.
You’re here early. What’s up?
You’re not hurt, are you?
Nope. Grandma told me to come get you.
They’ve finished building Kyla’s house, so she wants everyone to come and celebrate.
Alright, let’s go now.
Wow, it's beautiful.
Where are those butterflies going?
Wouldn’t they go back to where they came from?
But the flower...
Oh, over there! Over there!
Woohoo! The [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SunlightPotion_Name"))][/em1] is ready!
Let's go to the tree right away!
Ellie, the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1] is... 
Don't worry! I [em1]already[/em1] have the ingredients.
You already have them?
First is the [em1]'[lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))]'[/em1].
Do you really want to go [em1]now[/em1]?
Did you do [em1]everything you want to do[/em1]?
Not yet
Let's go now
I still have stuff to do.
Stop wasting time.
If you're done, let's talk to [em1]Rubrum[/em1] and go.
There’s nothing more to do!
Oh, the latch came off. It just opens.
I knew it.
Now let’s pray that there is a prickly vine nucleus behind this.
Or something fun.
It's been so long since all of us got together.
The fountain is restored now and I wanted to celebrate together again.
Thank you all for coming.
Come to think of it, I didn't give Ellie a proper welcoming.
Grandma's giant pie!
Then I’ll leave it to you, Arden.
Hmm, don’t get too close.
This should work.
I'm stuck in a spiderweb. Hehe.
My arms hurt.
Aren't you uncomfortable?
It actually feels like I'm floating. It's fun!
But I'm scared of big spiders.
I'll help you down, don't worry.
I'll help you down.
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))][/em1] is found near [em1]cliff[/em1].
Like this.
Wow, Virgil. There's someone stuck in the [em1]spiderweb[/em1].
I think he's lost consciousness.
Is he even alive?
I don't know... Um...
Gah!
They woke up.
Who...?
A witch?
Wow, this is my first time seeing an apprentice witch!
It's my first time seeing someone caught in a spiderweb.
My name is [em1]Rubrum[/em1].
I live in the village with my grandma.
But now I'm stuck in a big spiderweb.
He doesn't seem to understand the gravity of his situation...
A big spiderweb means there's a big spider nearby.
*Gasp*
You be quiet!
Don’t worry. You’ll be fine.
You have to be careful when dealing with spiderwebs, Ellie.
It looks pretty strong. One wrong move, and you'll get stuck it in yourself.
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))][/em1] works best against insects.
Just one [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))][/em1] should be enough.
I learned that [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))][/em1] grows on [em1]cliffs[/em1].
I'll bring it soon.
Yeah, come back soon.
If it is [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MapleHerb_Name"))], I have it.
It still hurts a bit...
I have to hurry up and get back to the village.
If not, grandma will scold me.
Okay. Leave it to me.
I’ll get rid of that huge prickly vine.
I'll make sure to get you back to your village. Don’t worry.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, before that, I should treat your [em1]leg[/em1] first.
Rubrum, wait here for a moment.
This must be the house of a person named [em1]Kyla[/em1].
It’s in the same condition as the other houses.
It’s a [em1]prickly vine[/em1].
Something seems [em1]different[/em1] from the prickly vines I saw so far, though...
We need more [em1]information[/em1] on this prickly vine.
Yeah you’re right.
Let’s talk to [em1]Enite[/em1] first.
I hope you'll change your mind.
We still don’t have enough [em1]information[/em1].
Let’s talk to the villagers a little more.
Let’s go look for the [em1]witch's house[/em1].
I think there was a [em1]book related to the prickly vine[/em1].
Just find the nucleus, make the potion and use it.
Now let’s go look for [em1]information[/em1].
How can a house be destroyed by the prickly vines like this?
Look at this house.
The decoration looks [em1]gorgeous[/em1].
What happened to the people who lived here?
Wouldn’t they have ran away while the prickly vine was growing?
I hope that was the case...
If you don't get rid of the prickly vines, there's no point in rebuilding the house.
Now that we know the location, let’s ask [em1]other villagers[/em1].
Now that the nucleus of the prickly vine is removed, it will become a nice house.
But how do you intend to get rid of the nucleus?
The Moon’s power should weaken the core, since it’s like the White Prickly Vine.
Is it [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))] again? Where are you going to get [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))]?
Let's just go buy a train ticket again.
Oh, we have [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))]... but [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))] is the problem.
I don't have that much money!
What do we do? Will Diane sell it?
Speaking of the moon... You picked up a note last time, didn’t you?
Oh! The note written in ancient witch language!
They would sell it for a high price, or not carry it.
I wonder if there’s a potion with the power of the moon among other potions...
Now that I think about it, it looked like a recipe.
How about decoding it first?
Good idea! Let's decode that first.
Diane would know if we ask her, right?
And it would be making moon’s... something potion to remove the prickly vine nucleus.
One would know if one didn't fall asleep in class like you.
I didn’t fall asleep either!
Look at this. It is definitely shaped like a prickly vine shape and colored like a [lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))].
Then that means the villagers couldn’t get rid of this prickly vine because...
Because you can’t get rid of it unless you get rid of the [em1]core[/em1] just like [lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))].
You can get rid of the prickly vine if you get rid of this [em1]prickly vine core[/em1].
Since it's a plant, the prickly vine and the core must be connected in some way.
Look over there!
The prickly vine is connected to the outside of village.
We can find the core if we follow that.
Alright, let’s go find the core.
People have died from reading too many books, haven’t they?
So much for all that confidence.
I actually have a disease that kills me if I read too many books, you know.
Stop complaining and keep searching. You’ve only gone through three books so far.
Only? C’mon, look at the size of these books!
It’s too much work. Can’t you read instead?
You sure you want to do that?
Of course. We’re friends, right?
Looks like the next few lines are about the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1].
<shake>What? Really?</shake>
[em1]Bitter Grape Tea Tree[/em1]. That’s the [em1]tree we saw at the summit[/em1]! The glowing one!
The glow came from the [em1]Blue Moon Butterflies[/em1].
Hmm, the tea leaves... Blah blah blah... tastes like grape... strong bitter taste... Oh, here it is.
Blah blah blah... It is also famous for its flowers, the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1]. 
[em1]<wave>[lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))]</wave>[/em1]! So it was here.
There’s still more information.
Hmm, it gathers moonlight most of the time, and on a moonless night, the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1] blooms.
A moonless night?
But the tree at the summit had [em1]Blue Moon Butterflies[/em1] flying around.
So the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))] couldn’t bloom because of the [em1]moonlight [/em1]emitted by the [em1]Blue Moon Butterflies[/em1]?
Yeah, it’s a commonly used method back in Lucerine Ortu.
So if we get rid of the [em1]<wave>Blue Moon Butterflies</wave>[/em1], then the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))] will bloom?!
Gather moonlight with the [em1]Blue Moon Butterflies[/em1], shoo them away, and collect the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1].
Alright! Let’s get rid of the [em1]Blue Moon Butterflies[/em1], make [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1], and remove the prickly vines!
But what do we use to get rid of the Blue Moon Butterflies?
They don't like sunlight, so a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SunlightPotion_Name"))][/em1] should work.
Let’s see here... Bitter Grape Tea Tree...?
Alright, let’s get this started. The [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1].
Alright, let’s make a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SunlightPotion_Name"))][/em1] and get rid of those butterflies!
This is fun.
Teehee
From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Ellie.
It feels like only good things are happening to the village since you arrived.
I’m also super happy because Ellie is here!
I got your letter. I was surprised.
Even when I left the village, I thought the prickly vines would never be removed.
Thank you again, Ellie.
I just did what a witch should do.
Come to think of it, Arden didn’t show again, right?
Right. Uncle Arden says he has to make stew.
He’s strangely diligent when there aren't many customers. Hahaha.
Thanks for everything, Ellie. Keep up the good work.
Keep up the good work!
I'll go out of my way to help if Ellie's asking.
I look forward to your support.
Oh, Ellie. Let me talk to you for a minute before you go.
What’s up, Enite?
I looked around the village yesterday.
The giant prickly vines had made me lose hope that this day would come.
It brings back old memories to see Kyla's house and Roy's house built so well.
Thank you so much, Ellie. It wouldn't be enough to thank you a hundred times.
No, not at all. It's something that I wanted to do.
The ruins back here used to be a fountain. 
We used to gather here to chat, share snacks, and sing.
I want to have an area like this ready for the others that may return in the future.
I really shouldn't ask... but could you help me?
Sure. I made a promise to help the villagers return.
Thank you, Ellie. You can talk to Kyla for the details.
Please leave it to me.
[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))] is ready!
I finally made one with my own hands...
Be careful handling it. It’s probably supervised by the administration for a reason.
Yes, of course. Because no one should get hurt.
Let’s take the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))] to Enite.
Haha! I passed the Gaga Bird safely!
Wow, what’s this? A garden door?
Why is something like this here?
I think they were trying to block something.
At a place like this? Who? What? From what?
Looking at how the prickly vines are connected, I think the nucleus is inside.
There was something similar at home.
Hmm... Blue...
Oh! The place where I saved Rubrum! I think I saw a blue pattern!
There was something behind it. Let’s go there.
Let's go to the place we saw when we saved Rubrum.
But I don't think I've ever seen anything like that while walking around the forest... Oh wait.
Something’s dropped over here... A chalk?
I don’t think there was any blue pattern around here.
Hmm... It’s on the tip of my tongue...
Did someone make it to protect the nucleus?
It seems to be the case.
We need to open this door first.
There must be a witch pattern somewhere like the other doors in the forest.
Let’s do what’s important at this time for now.
I think I've seen something similar to this somewhere.
Let’s concentrate on what we’re doing for now.
Where did you go, Virgil?
Why are you talking nonsense after a good night's rest?
What...? You weren’t there.
Stop sleep talking and wash your face first.
What’s the...? Was it just a dream?
It's just in your head.
What’s this?... This uncomfortable feeling...
Did you have a nightmare or something?
No, it wasn’t a nightmare... I’m sure I had a dream but can’t remember anything.
Hmmm... Maybe because I’m a witch.
It's morning. Stop sleep talking and wake up.
I'm only a witch...
Miracle morning!
Yikes!
What kind of dream is this obnoxious?
Huh? You're right. What kind of dream was that?
Very strange.
What nonsense is this after a good night's sleep.
I had a strange dream.
Ugh... I don’t remember.
Ellie, it’s time to get up.
Get out of bed if you're awake.
*Groan*...
You just woke up. Why do you look dead already.
I think I had an important dream, but I can't remember it.
It seemed like something important...
Like the principal's sermon?
That's something I don't want to think about again...
Eeek! I can’t catch it by hand!
Did you really think a butterfly is stupid enough to just get caught willingly?
Then, what do you want me to do?
You said you would fill the [em1]catalog[/em1]. What’s left?
Oh! The quill!
First, I’ll register them in the [em1]catalog[/em1] with this.
Let’s use the [em1]quill[/em1] to register [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonButterfly_Name"))][/em1] in the [em1]encyclopedia[/em1] and try[em1]opening it up[/em1].
Alright, who's the next villager?
Only one has arrived so far.
First time is always the hardest. It’ll be quick from now on.
Should I start from the front?
Maybe I should plan this out first.
Well... I’m trying to look elsewhere...
The [em1]bridge[/em1] is like this.
I mean, it’s be better to do what's in front of me rather than try fixing the bridge.
Good, the next villager lives just below Kyla’s house.
First, let’s talk to [em1]Enite[/em1].
This is simple for someone like me, Ellie Blueriver!
Enite! Who’s house is the one below Kyla’s?
Kyla just arrived, she’s very diligent.
Seeing that Kyla likes it, I want to make sure the other villagers return soon.
Yes, I understand.
The house below Kyla’s is [em1]Roy’s[/em1] house.
Roy!
He’s a very kind and upright young man that runs a flower shop.
A flower shop! Must be pretty.
He was a very diligent and kind young man. He also took care of the flowers in the village.
When Roy left, the flowers in the village started to wither.
The town will become prettier once Roy returns.
Oh, also, the [em1]bridge[/em1] seems to be destroyed. Is there a village past the bridge?
Yes, there are people living beyond the bridge.
Once Roy comes back, we’ll have to fix the bridge first.
I agree.
I’ll write a letter to Roy.
I can’t possibly have him stay at someone else’s house when he returns...
Understood. I’ll talk to Kyla.
Ellie, I want you to go to [em1]Kyla[/em1] and help build Roy’s house.
The prickly vines destroyed the houses, and the bridge as well.
I’ll leave it to you.
Kyla, do you have a moment?
Hya Hya! I was just kidding. What’s going on?
I’m sorry to ask this of you as soon as you're back, but...
I want to have the other villagers return like you did.
I was hoping you could build the houses for the other villagers.
Hya Hya! I was wondering what you were going to say.
Of course I’ll help. I was going to ask you the same thing.
Is Roy the next lucky villager?
I knew because we lived in the same village. Hya Hya!
What kind of person is Roy?
He was a good-looking, kind friend. A bit lacking in terms of brawn.
And... Hmm...
Thinking back, I guess I didn’t get to talk to Roy much. Hya Hya!
If you’re curious, ask around.
Is there something I can help you with when you build the house?
In order to begin, I need a [em1]House Blueprint[/em1] and [em1]foundation materials[/em1].
Talk to [em1]Aurea[/em1] for the Blueprints. She’ll sell it to you.
[em1]Foundation Materials[/em1] can easily be found in the forest.
So, if I bring the [em1]Blueprint[/em1] and the [em1]Foundation Materials[/em1], we can build Roy's house.
Yes. You can deliver a little at a time, so just let me know when you bring any.
The only one still left in the area is Roy’s house.
You know Roy?
No, I’m busy.
Oh, then I’ll be back later.
Roy is kind and diligent.
No one asked him to take care of the flowers, but he did it anyway.
As a result, the village looked a lot better when Roy was here. There weren’t any weeds either.
Roy?
I heard he ran a flower shop in the village.
Oh, yes.
He didn’t come to the restaurant very often, so I never saw him much.
So, I don’t know him very well.
Let’s talk to Kyla about it then.
Oh, the owner of the flower shop, right? I know, I know!
He used to buy seeds and seedlings. He even took orders to make flower bouquets.
He was pretty good. He wasn’t a master craftsman, but had good hands.
Above all else, he was a pleasant young man, because he was thorough in keeping his promises.
Aww, so cute!
Teehee!
I never thought this day would come.
I can’t recall the last time I’ve been this excited.
I’m glad to see Kyla too!
Everything you do is so cool, Ellie.
I got your letter. It filled me with joy.
If you need help restoring the village, just let me know.
Thank you, Miss Witch.
By the way, where’s Arden?
Uncle Arden couldn’t come. He said he had to open up shop.
But, he told me to tell you that you did a good job.
Aw, shucks.
We’re forever in your debt, Ellie dearie.
Keep up the good work, Ellie!
You got this.
I’ll try my best, so that the other villagers can return.
Hello, Ellie. Would you like to join?
One, two, one, two.
There are very, very cool heroes living here.
I’ll make a huge castle.
Grandma says don’t go too far out.
The wind feels good.
I wish I had more friends.
What would be cool to make?
Hello, Ellie. Did you find a new place?
I want to find delicious tea leaves.
I also want to go on an adventure once in a while. Would grandma scold me?
What would other forests look like?
Grandma said she would bake us pies once we finish our meal.
She said I should never skip meals because I’ll end up suffering when I'm old!
Tick-tock tick-tock for a long time! Tick-tock tick-tock with grandpa!
The clock has stopped! My grandpa's wall clock!
Will there be treasures in the Green Forest?
My feet get wobbly when I'm on a boat. Is the sea just wavy land in disguise?
The morning wind feels good.
Welcome. The sun feels so nice again today.
Once you've made it, the red looks bright and pretty.
I used to read fairy tales whenever Rubrum didn’t want to go to sleep.
Should I weave a hat for you?
Time flies when I’m like this.
There are many pretty bookmarks in the forest.
We used to chat here.
I’m lonely.
I wonder if everyone is doing well.
Don’t skip meals and eat well.
Rubrum used to be a picky eater when he was young, so mincing the vegetables for him became a habit.
It’s good to see you eating well.
There is no set recipe. I learned it by watching.
Once upon a time, there lived a very kind and diligent boy.
I wish I could read you a new story instead of the ones I always read to you.
I’m swinging my hammer diligently.
The hard stuff always tastes great after a good sweat.
Getting firewood and training at the same time, killing two birds with one stone.
Argh! One! Two!
Mhmm. This is the pepper taste I was looking for.
Delicious food and cold drinks. A day’s bliss.
There’s a specific sound that comes from wood well trimmed.
I’m trying to make a few things.
Can you hear the song of the hammer? It’s my favorite song.
It’s a sound that resonates with the soul, hahaha!
It’ll take some time, but I’m working hard.
Gather what results from throwing the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "NutritionPotion_Name"))][/em1] at the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FlowerBird_Name"))][/em1].
[em1]Diane[/em1] said to talk to her if you run out of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "NutritionPotion_Name"))][/em1].
Throw the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "NutritionPotion_Name"))][/em1] I just gave you at the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FlowerBird_Name"))][/em1].
Out of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "NutritionPotion_Name"))][/em1].
Oh dear. I can give you more, but please be careful.
There is a limit to how much I can hold.
We don’t accept potion deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
We must return to the train by[em1]tomorrow morning[/em1].
The [em1]Shining Tree[/em1] is at the [em1]peak of the mountain[/em1], so go quickly if you want to see it.
Yeah, yeah.
Great. It's time to explore!
Please don't use that word... "Explore..."
That word gives me anxiety, no thanks to your mother.
Wow! It's the [em1]gigantic shining tree[/em1]! The same one we saw from the train!
Check this out, Virgil. There are a ton of butterflies on it.
You’re right. The butterflies seem to be glowing.
These are [em1]Bluemoon Butterflies[/em1].
The butterflies give off a subtle moonlight. 
The light from these butterflies has the same power as [em1]actual moonlight[/em1]. 
That's why strange things always happen around these butterflies.
Aren't they beautiful? A [em1]giant tea tree[/em1] with [em1]butterflies glowing with moonlight[/em1].
It's not just beautiful. It's an extremely fascinating sight to behold.
Isn't this a pretty magnificent discovery?
I'll have to write a letter to the school later.
Fill up the [em1]codex[/em1] and all, right?
Just don't be late.
We must return to the train by [em1]tomorrow morning[/em1].
Let's go back the [em1]way we came up[/em1]. There might be other strange things.
Did you know that those two are rare creatures?
What? So what about it?
The fact that those two are together is amazing.
This is a [em1]Bitter Grape Tea Tree[/em1]. I don’t think the tree is the one that’s shining.
What about those two being together?
They’re usually raised together artificially to get [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1] in Lucerine Ortu.
It’s uncommon for them to be together naturally like this.
Um, anyway, we did find something, right?
Alright... Grind this well and...
It worked!
It’s strange to have such a bad taste when there isn't any smell.
You wouldn't have had to eat it if you didn’t go in and out of places that were forbidden.
Don't you know that the basics of a witch are curiosity and passion for inquiry?
The problem is that most of them are things you shouldn’t do.
So now, shall we try sprinkling it on the pepper?
Hmm.
They said that the powder glows when it’s on a curse but...
Surprisingly, nothing happened.
Still, it's now clear that there is no curse.
Arden seemed to be convinced somehow...
Hmm... Something feels uncomfortable.
Because Arden might not believe it?
Well, rather than that... I wonder what could be the cause of the inability to sleep.
If you really feel so, make some Curse Lifting Candy or something.
It would work even if it was cursed by something other than pepper.
I should try that for now.
Is it delicious?
Yes. I did a good job of preventing you from putting in a bucket full of pepper.
So what’s the meaning of the saying that dragons live multiple lives?
A dragon lives a thousand years. That's like accumulating an enormous amount of memories.
Wow, do they remember all of that?
They can’t, because they’d go crazy if they do. So it disappears at some point.
That’s why it is said that they live many lives.
Oh oh...
After hearing what you said, I felt that someone might have cursed me in the past that I can't remember now.
Is there anything that comes to mind?
I can only recall fragments of it but...
Burning the hair off of a guy who was after my treasure with eternal fire or...
Breaking the waist of a drunken man at the restaurant and throwing him out or...
Flying around with a guy picking a fight tied to my foot for three days.
At this point, it also makes sense to say you've accumulated curses.
It was self-defense.
Anyway, a few things came to my mind, but I don't know the exact cause either.
Did you happen to have some kind of incident with another witch?
You said you hate witches.
That might be so. 
Something feels uncomfortable about witches.
Hmm... Could it be a curse that is triggered when certain conditions are met...?
Can I ask you a few things?
Reason for running a restaurant
Past
Reason for staying in Wisteria
I don’t know. I've just always been doing it, since the moment I remember.
Since when?
Well... Even before Enite was born?
I protected the treasure just like other dragons.
Treasure!
I want to say that I’d give you one if you took care of the curse, but I don't know where it is now.
At that time, all kinds of people came to visit. Maybe there were witches too.
What are you curious about?
Because I like wisteria flowers.
Are you even Arden?
No, I don’t know who's that.
You don’t know who Arden is, but you remember the fact that you liked it?
Wisteria flowers have strong vitality. That’s why I like them.
Who are you talking about?
......
I’ve asked everyone.
I've finished it completely.
As I was saying...
Hmm... Then should we start by recovering your memories?
Why are you helping me this much?
Because I’m a witch
Because I’m getting worked up
Because I feel sorry for you
A witch is always ready to help, starting with the one who needs it the most.
This is my creed.
Since it ended up like that, I feels uncomfortable if I don’t resolve it.
I’d also have to get rid of your stigma on witches.
You were probably cursed by someone you can’t even remember.
That's why you don't even realize how crooked you are, right?
I was harsh earlier. I apologize.
Humph. The water's already been spilled.
But, I'll forgive you since I'm curious about your past.
Alright, next would be...
Let’s stop for today. My head hurts from thinking about all of this.
Huh? But...
He kicked me out!
At least he only kicked you out after filling up your stomach.
Since it ended up like this, I’ll make sure that I find out the secret.
Do you also consider what you can't remember a secret?
Everything that hasn’t been revealed is a secret!
Alright. Let's gather more clues and aim for the next one.
I wasn't expecting much, but still.
The box is a treasure chest.
Shall we take a look?
You remind me of your mother because she used to open everything that’s been found.
Only Arden would put food ingredients in a treasure chest.
But still, food ingredients in a treasure chest is a little odd.
It's up to the owner to decide what to put in it.
Still.
Why are there so many radishes?
I don't think I've seen it in stew either.
It's not radish, it's parsnip.
It’s an ingredient often put in stews and pies.
Aha.
No, I searched all the way to the bottom and found nothing but radish.
I told you that it’s parsnip.
Radish hell!
You’re not listening to me, right?
I remember. It’s radish.
You’re saying that it's dark to decorate a restaurant with weapons, right?
It just looks so easy to put on a curse.
Look at this broken figure.
They’re just old, broken sword and shield.
Maybe there’s something written on them.
There’s nothing.
I said they’re just old things.
The wretched soul of a treasure-seeking warrior downed by the dragon’s flames!
Shush.
But, why are these things really here?
Kyla's failed collection?
They’re too old for that.
This is really...
Surprisingly...
Just junk.
Because the world is not your oyster.
Why are you saying like it’s someone else’s business?!
It can’t be like this.
What are you going to do?
Arden said some of the things thrown away seem to have been taken by other people.
I should go ask the villagers.
It would be much better than just looking through junk!
Someone who would curse Arden?
Who would curse a good dragon like Arden?
Good... dragon?
Ellie, that wasn’t the case with you?
He just said a lot of bad things to me!
It seems like there's some kind of story behind it.
Speaking of a story, have you ever received anything from Arden?
He was about to throw away a bunch of good stuff. So I brought something.
Here it is.
Isn't it a little small for Arden to wear?
Arden also said that’s the reason he threw it away.
There must have been someone else at the restaurant before.
This is the thing that Arden threw away.
I’m not sure about the curse.
It’s a spooky story.
Wait a minute, Ellie.
I heard that Arden threw away a bunch of stuff again some time ago.
I heard about this from Aurea. Are you looking for them?
I don't know what you're looking for, but I hope it goes well.
Thank you, Enite.
Ask only after you've spoken to Arden.
Curse? What’s the curse? The thing in the treasure?
Hmm... A curse that doesn't allow you to talk about anything except nature or...
That makes you keep having nightmares and can't sleep or...
Makes you have hiccups every time you eat an apple...?
Did Uncle Arden get one?
Maybe. I'm investigating because I'm not sure.
Did you happen to take anything that Arden threw away?
Yes! This one! Sparkly and pretty!
The picture drawn on the teacup is a Gold Coin... That's quite materialisitic.
I can't imagine Arden using this...
Uncle said he was not going to use it and that’s why he’s throwing it away.
Other than this, there were other times when Uncle Arden threw something away.
Aurea told me as she was giving me candy.
I should also go to Aurea.
Thanks, Rubrum.
Oh, Ellie.
This is the thing that uncle threw away. Isn’t it beautiful?!
It looks just like the treasure hidden by pirates.
A curse... What a funny story.
If it was Arden, he could have gotten it.
He's a dragon and blunt. Hahaha!
That's right. He’s so indifferent.
That man is not a kind person.
Kyla, have you ever seen Arden throwing anything away?
Oh, oh. This one's for me. They threw away such a nice glass. 
There are letters engraved.
Yes, that’s right. There were two conspicuous A's engraved.
Maybe it says 'A curse on Arden'? Hahaha!
This probably isn’t the only thing that Arden threw away.
The merchant who often comes to that village...
I heard that person also saw it recently. Try going there.
You’re talking about Aurea, right? Thank you, Kyla.
So, am I holding an object that curses Arden?
Oh, I don't mean myself. Don't get me wrong. Hahaha!
No way. that’s a taboo word.
No, Aurea. It’s not about pepper.
Really? A curse just makes me shudder. Ho Ho.
I heard that Aurea saw Arden throwing away stuff.
Do you remember anything?
Hmm... Perhaps not long after you removed the gigantic prickly vine...
I saw Arden carrying a huge package.
Since I saw him on the way to the village...
I think it was in the direction of deep forest.
Are you looking for the curse on Arden?
I’m not sure if it’s a curse yet.
Cheer up. Get rid of the curse on my pepper.
I don't remember something in particular.
I've told you everything.
I hope I get to work on something here later.
It’s pretty useless now though.
Okay, let’s fix the broom.
You know how to fix brooms?
Of course. Broom maintenance is a standard course at the school.
I remember the broom you were working on. It flew as it spewed water from behind.
I wanted it to spit fire, but wasn’t water cool too?
You're lucky it was summer, and that it wasn’t fire.
No one would have laughed if wasn’t one of those two.
It was just once.
I can fix it if I have the [em1]required materials[/em1].
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))][/em1] or [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Mud_Name"))][/em1] can be easily found in the forest.
I don’t see anything by the lake.
Arden did say he couldn’t find it.
It must be someplace else, considering we can’t find the lamp out here in the open.
Why don’t you go ask someone else who prances around in the Woods like you?
I’m not just prancing around, I’m here because I have work to do!
But I guess it won’t hurt to ask around.
It’s supposed to be a special silver lamp without any wicks or candles.
You’ve seen it somewhere?
It’s Uncle Arden’s right?
I picked it up near the lake and I was gonna give it to him.
But I discovered a new tea leaf on the way and I completely forgot about it!
Where was this?
I drew a diagram, so I could go back.
Alright. I’ll find it and give it to Arden.
Since it’s you, I’ll let you have a look.
Alright! Found it!
I’ve seen plenty of lamps.
It’s not your average lamp.
It’s silver lamp that glows gently, with no wick or candle.
Come to think of it, I think I’ve seen Rubrum holding something similar.
He said it was Arden’s, and that he was going to return it to him.
I should ask Rubrum then. Thanks!

Woah!
It's so pretty! Ellie, you’re the best!
Wow, seeing the fireworks from Wisteria is great too.
Gorgeous.
Those were some great fireworks.
It’s so beautiful.
The ones I saw with my husband a long time ago were just like this.
Thank you, Ellie.
I’m so glad everyone likes it.
Now, let’s all have some pie.
It's been a while since I baked a pie this big, so I’m not sure how it’ll taste.
Rubrum, will you please help?
You live in Highlion?
Correct. I own a flower shop there.
Were you on your way somewhere?
Yes. I met an old friend of mine.
Nothing you'd find exciting.
Wow, must’ve been fun.
...Correct.
It’s unremarkable.
Did you used to own a flower shop in Highlion?
Yes, I closed it down to come here.
Weren’t you sad?
Hmm... I would be lying If I said I wasn’t.
What makes you sad about it?
There was a bakery I always went to for breakfast.
The bagels and donuts from there were delicious. I miss those.
Ah. I still remember the food I ate on the train.
Riding the train until my butt pretty much melted was terrifying, though.
But, it was a flavor that I will never forget.
I heard a train ticket costs the same as 300 pies. How did you get one?
It’s a bit embarrassing to say this with my own mouth... But, I had a lot of customers visiting my shop.
Wow, your shop must have been popular.
Yes, I’m very thankful.
Is there a reason why you started a flower shop?
Well... The reason isn’t very fun, to say the least.
Still. Usually there's a reason.
That reason really isn’t anything special.
Pft.
I always wake up at a set time in the morning.
It was great to be able to come back to Wisteria.
Handling flowers puts my mind at ease.
I do run a flower shop...but as you can see, I’m just a normal passenger at the moment.
I’m still preparing.
Since I'm not much of a talker... I don't have anything to say in particular.
Good to see you again.
Yes, we met inside the train.
How are your shoes... Did you wear them when you got off?
I didn’t even go to Highlion!
Ellie, do you like flowers?
Hmm... I feel better when I look at them.
Reminds me of my mom.
Your mother must like flowers.
She used to gift them to Dad often.
She gave some to me at times too.
How heartwarming.
Thank you for the kind words, but it’s just a habit.
Um... Even to friends?
Yes, usually.
Each flower has its own language.
And, you know all of them?
At least for the flowers I sell.
Flowers are often sought as gifts, so I try to recommend ones fit for each situation.
Did you know there are also edible flowers?
I’ve seen a few used as dessert decorations.
If it’s okay with you, I’ll show you a few next time.
The right flowers are said to make a meal more enjoyable.
Please let me know if you ever need flowers.
All my flowers are always kept fresh.
Now, I’m going to bring back the person that used to live here.
His name was Roy, right? I’d like to meet him soon.
Wow... It smells amazing.
It’s the giant pie that grandma used to talk about!
Wow, it's been a really long time.
I couldn't find this flavor even in the famous bakery in Highlion.
Ahem, it seems to be baked well.
Even Ellie prepared something amazing this time.
Here, Ellie. It’s your turn.
Here goes! A refreshing [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))]!
Expand storage
Is there something you want to do?
Want to expand your storage? Bring me the ingredients and I'll do it for you.
To grow the storage by 4 spaces, you need [em1][lua(consumeMoney)] [lua(GetLocalizedString("Common", "NormalCoin"))][/em1] and [em1][lua(consumeBranch)] [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))][/em1].
Here, I have improved the storage. You’ll be able to put in more things.
I think you don’t have enough materials. Check it out.
To grow the storage by 4 spaces, you need [em1][lua(consumeMoney)] [lua(GetLocalizedString("Common", "NormalCoin"))][/em1], [em1][lua(consumeBranch)] [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))][/em1] and [em1][lua(consumeRock)] [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Rock_Name"))][/em1].
Bring it anytime since I’m free.
There’s nothing more to do at the moment.
Come by anytime.
I don’t have any items ready now.
Sell potion
Did you bring some nice potions?
Expand bag.
Want to buy a bigger bag?
A bag that is 4 spaces larger costs [em1][lua(consumeMoney)] Gold Coins[/em1]. Are you going to buy it?
Here is a new bag.
I don’t think I have enough money.
The bag is [em1][lua(consumeMoney)] Gold Coins[/em1].
Okay, take time to think it over.
Did you gather the materials?
Great, I’m super motivated.
You can take your time, but it has to be within today.
It’ll be useless if the house is already complete.
I'll do my best to make a good one!
Wow, what is this place?
Looks like some kind of puzzle, Virgil!
It's a very suspicious and unnatural sight.
Let’s solve this puzzle first.
For Kyla, right?
Of course. Don’t ask twice.
That looks like a [em1]seesaw[/em1] and a [em1]weight[/em1]...?
Who made something like this?
It feels similar to the ones we saw in the forest.
It got bigger!
I smell something fishy here.
Look around you.
It’s a witch bookshelf!
Technically, it’s a bookshelf that the witch was using.
That’s same as a witch bookshelf!
I'm not going to read a book though. I'm tired of books.
[em1]A poisonous mushroom[/em1] is better than [em1]a witch who doesn’t read books[/em1].
What does that mean?
Because [em1]a poisonous mushroom[/em1] kills [em1]just one person[/em1].
Stop nagging. I read enough books at school!
Hmm, Witch History: The 12 Plants, Fun Book of Plants, Gardening for Witches...
There are so many books on plants.
I guess a witch who used to research plants was living here.
I should store any books I get in here.
Diane, can you read what’s written on this note?
A note? Shall I take a look?
Hmm... This is ancient witch language.
Can you read it?
See? You’re the only one who fell asleep in the class.
Hmm... Moon’s...
Moon’s...?
Moon’s...
I can only read up to this.
I remember learning it when I was attending school.
What does it say?
I forgot everything because it's been a while since I've learned it and I haven't used it either.
That's because Diane graduated a long time ago. What's your excuse?
It hasn’t been that long since I graduated either...
Then, is there any way to decode the ancient witch language?
Of course there is a way!
Ancient witch language is definitely a subject you learn in school! 
So, there also must be knowledge on the ancient witch language in Ellie's head.
In short, it's not a matter of knowledge but a matter of intelligence that brings it out.
That hurt a little.
Truth hurts.
That's why I recommend the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "IntUpPotion_Name"))][/em1].
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "IntUpPotion_Name"))][/em1]!
It raises your level of intelligence, like memory, deduction, and language.
[em1]Deciphering[/em1] ancient witch language’ll be easy with better memory and deduction.
Sounds like a drug peddler.
This is real. I only use the recipes approved by the Witch Potion Society.
Careful though, long-term usage can cause vomiting and intellectual decline.
They don't seem minor...
Don’t worry because there is no problem at all if you use it once or twice in a while.
Since I have the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "IntUpPotion_Name"))][/em1] recipe registered in [em1]the Witches' Catalogue[/em1], you can buy one if you need it.
Wait, I forgot the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UnreadableMemo_Name"))][/em1].
Did you say you couldn’t get much sleep lately?
And it seems to be because you had some kind of dream?
Oh, how about this?
A fainting pillow! The moment you lie down, it knocks you out, hence the name.
No, I...
This is the work of Herencia, who is called the master of sleep and the queen of the night.
You’ll sleep like baby, even [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))] won’t help you remember your dreams. Try it!
[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))]!
Would you like to buy a fainting pillow?
I need to craft a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))].
Alright, got it. I’ll also register [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RememberDreamPotion_Name"))] on the list. 
And also give me the pillow.
Thank you. Please order the pillow through the catalogue as well..
Aurea, do you have the House Blueprints?
Yes, of course I do!
Is it for the other villagers’ houses?
Which villager is moving back this time?
A villager named Roy.
Roy... Ah, the owner of the flower shop.
I happen to have the flower shop Blueprint too. I’ll put it up on the shop.
Diane, can you also get me the Curse Detection Candy?
Of course. I’ll add it right away, since we happen to have it in stock.
Are you going to use it?
Uh... that's right, but is there a different version with improved taste?
You’re lucky. This happens to be an improved version.
It used to taste like grilled fish left to rot at room temperature for 3 days...
They say it has now improved to taste like mucus from when you catch a cold.
If you feel uncomfortable eating it, you can also consider grinding and sprinkling it.
Was there such method?!
I told you to read the book to the end.
Shush...
[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))]. It’s a potion I’ve always wanted to try making.
You too, Diane?
Sure. It’s the highlight of the [em1]Star Gun Festival[/em1].
Right. I liked the fireworks on the last day the most, too.
There's somewhere I want to use it in this time. Can I get the recipe?
Hmm... It’s not hard to register the recipe in the catalog but...
Ellie, as you likely already know, it's forbidden to craft a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))] while enrolled in the School for Witches.
Even when I’m just an apprentice?!
To be exact, there are limitations.
You have to report how many and for what purpose to the Witch Administration.
<shake>Th.. the.. Administration...</shake>
Ellie, you must have two left feet!
Still haven't found the recipe?
T... They say I would have to report it to the administration...
Oh, you can just use the master witch's name.
Please fill out the master witch’s name, your name, the intended purpose, and how many, right here.
Confirmed. I will add it to the Witches' Catalogue.
Phew... My heart pounds out of my chest every time something like this happens.
Stop acting, it's terrible. You’ll get caught.
But I have no choice.
I wrote down my [em1]mom’s name[/em1] because it was the only thing I could think of... That should be fine, right?
I’m really getting worried.
Before the laws, a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))] would often blow the butts off people or burn down houses...
My name is Diane. Thank you for coming today.
Let’s go make a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))], since we accomplished our goal.
<shake>The master witch’s name...?</shake>
What? Ellie, you little furball!
You’re writing MY name with your hellish handwriting?
It looks like the master witch has quite a temper.
If you’d like, you can also put the name of someone else.
<shake>T... Then...</shake>
<shake>Aria... and Ellie. Just 1. For the village party...</shake>
Oh... Wow...
Ellie? Let's go back to the train...
[em1]<shake>Look at that, Virgil!</shake>[/em1]
A shining white cat?
I've never seen anything like that before!
Ellie? We have to–
[em1]<shake>Let's go after that creature!</shake>[/em1]
Look, Virgil! There's a house!
That's a [em1]witch's house[/em1], isn't it?
It looks pretty old.
I guess we can talk to the master witch here and stay here for a while.
It doesn't look like there are people inside...
If there's no one, I might stay for a while.
Isn’t it natural for an [em1]apprentice witch[/em1] to be at the [em1]witch’s house[/em1]?
Huh? Where did the cat go?
It really is the [em1]sound of the train[/em1]!
I think it's about to take off.
Let's hurry back.
I woke up just in time.
Glad I didn't sleep in.
Where's the [em1]train[/em1]?
Hahaha! Looks like that [em1]bird[/em1] was imitating [em1]train sounds[/em1].
But where's the train?
It probably went to Highlion.
Then what do we do now?
Let's look around [em1]the area[/em1]. I'm sure we'll find some clues.
Why are you so calm?
I've been through much worse with your mom.
Wow, it worked!
Good. This probably got rid of the village's prickly vines as well.
Now I can bring Kyla to the village.
Let’s hurry up and go to the village.
Hello. You’re Kyla, right?
Oh, hello. I guess you’re the witch who helped Enite.
I’m Ellie, an apprentice witch. You can speak comfortably.
Really? Then I’ll talk comfortably.
I mean, witches are often older than they look.
I’m just as old as I look.
You came so fast.
That’s because there is a witch who wants to see me quickly.
I came in a flash since everyone was waiting.
If I’m welcome at any time, I’m also welcome today, right?
I really missed you. 
Of course. You’re welcome anytime.
Enite told me that an apprentice witch said I wanted to come back.
Was I right?
Thanks for helping me to return, apprentice witch.
Thank you for coming too.
Whoa, it’s a flying carpenter.
Sorry if I let you down, but I can't fly.
This is my friend, the talking witch hat named Virgil.
Nice to meet you, Virgil.
You don’t need to thank me, carpenter who can’t fly.
From now on, you will have to swing your hammer as much as flapping your wings.
Haha, don’t worry. My arms are stronger than they look.
Are you fixing your house?
I’m making a new one rather than fixing.
It might take some time.
Wow, can I come and watch?
Of course. Come anytime.
It looks like you’re about four arms short. Will you be okay?
It has been enough so far according to my experience.
Of course I wanted to come back. I like this village.
I can work here more comfortably than anywhere else.
I might need the witch’s help.
Let me know at anytime.
I will.
Sure. Everyone missed Kyla.
Don't you need House Blueprints?
Usually, they're necessary.
This is the house that I’ll be living in, so I prepared one.
Do you need one to build houses for others?
Yes. In order to build a house, a [em1]House Blueprint[/em1] and [em1]Foundation Materials[/em1] are necessary.
The [em1]Blueprint[/em1] can be purchased by talking to [em1]Aurea[/em1].
[em1]Foundation Materials[/em1] can be found in the forest. Good materials can be found in the forest around here.
How long does it take to build your house?
I’m going to start building tomorrow and it should take about a day.
Hey! You're not working!
It’s break time.
Is it going well?
Yeah, no big deal.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Let’s see. Hmm...
Alright then. Can you do me a favor?
Rubrum borrowed my shovel and hasn't returned it to me yet.
Since I think I have to use the shovel a little bit later, would you meet Rubrum and get it for me?
Bring it to me if you find it.
Is that so? Come back if you change your mind.
Oh, Ellie. Thank goodness you're here.
Hello. Something wrong?
I’m baking a pie, but I’ve ran out of the final ingredients.
Would you kindly do me a favor?
I would go myself, but my body isn’t what it used to be...
With that cigar in your mouth, you look like you're puffing flames.
Is that so.
Hm? Do you have something to say?
Actually, it’s my first time seeing a dragon in the flesh. You can imagine how intrigued I am.
I suppose there aren't many dragons that mingle with humans.
How do you breathe fire?
Why? You plannin’ on learnin’?
It’s my [em1]<wave>lifelong dream</wave>[/em1] to be able to breathe fire!
Pretty simple for a lifelong dream.
I won’t need your soul, but if you do me a [em1]favor[/em1] I’ll teach you.
A favor?
There’s something I asked of from [em1]Rubrum[/em1].
My throat gets sore after spewing too much fire. 
If you asked Rubrum, I’m assuming it’s tea?
Yeah, it’s a [em1]tea that soothes your throat[/em1], apparently.
I can’t leave my cauldron alone.
So why don’t you go get it from Rubrum?
Then you’ll teach me how to breathe fire?
Sure. But there’s no guarantee you’ll be able to do it.
Alright. I’ll be back in a jiffy!
If you can’t find [em1]Rubrum[/em1], you should go ask [em1]Enite[/em1].
I’d sell my [em1]soul[/em1] if I could breathe fire.
I don’t think I have time right now.
Then come when you do.
I've found it.
You found it pretty quick. Did you meet Rubrum?
No, I only found the shovel in the forest.
I guess he forgot about the shovel and went somewhere to play again.
Thanks for finding the shovel. Now I can finish up the house.
Did you find the shovel?
No, I didn’t find it yet.
Take your time. We still got time.
Rubrum still didn’t bring me the shovel.
Did you decide to find my shovel?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Nothing in particular but... Oh, do you have a favorite shape?
Rectangle
Arch
Triangle
Heart
A shape? Why?
I’m contemplating the shape of the second floor terrace door. Pick one for me.
I think rectangle would be nice.
I think arch would be nice.
I think triangle would be nice.
I think heart would be nice.
A rectangle is good for doors I believe.
An arch type goes well as I expected. You have a good eye.
Yes, a triangle type would also be pretty.
It would be cute.
Okay, thanks for your help.
Come take a look once it gets finished.
Alright, I’ll be sure to come see it.
Should I give the shovel back to Kyla?
Yes. I think he was playing in the sand with the shovel.
He hasn’t changed. He’s always loved playing with sand. 
This is Diane Greenwind bringing you happiness today. Nice to meet you!

<Life with Mushrooms>
Preface
Open any page
Epilogue
Mushrooms are everywhere, and not a single one is a bad mushroom.
Unless you're a small child who takes anything interesting and puts them into your mouth.
But such a passionate and pure inquiry process is indispensable.
We stand upon the bodies of the pure-hearted explorers. No need to join them.
In that sense, this book was not written only with my own effort.
In honor of Sherry, the purest and most passionate explorer.
I know this book. They recommended it to me at school.
But why didn’t you read it?
Mara Smith, who wrote this book...
The kids said she died from eating poisonous mushrooms.
That’s why I didn’t read it.
She was also a passionate and pure explorer.
Where should I look this time?
Black dragon scale mushroom
This is a black mushroom that looks like dragon scales. The surface is very hard and rough.
It usually grows from tree bark, with at least 10 bundled up together.
When roasted, it is great to have as a snack because it becomes crispy.
It has the effect of making the skin firm. Be careful as it will cause keratin if you eat too much.
This I know. During festivals, they fry and sprinkle it with sugar. So crunchy!
Golden wine glass
It is a cup-shaped mushroom with a bright golden color.
It usually grows in places with occasional sunlight, such as the inside of rotten tree trunks.
Death if you eat it and eternal life if you drink the dew within, as they say.
It’s toxic when eaten, but when used medicinally, it’s very potent.
A mushroom that looks like a wine glass made of gold?
A stupid witch is worse than a poisonous mushroom.
The red blood-like dews will be formed there? How can you pass up on this?
Come dawn, blood-red dew forms within the mushroom, and no, you’ll still die.
Isn't the person who wants to drink it crazy?
They wouldn’t drink it. You’ll feel like dying if you drink it even without any skull marks.
But someone must have drank it to know that you'll die, right?
Must have been the most naive and passionate explorer.
Rain cloud mushroom
It is a mushroom that looks like a pure white cotton ball.
It usually grows by sticking to living trees.
If it absorbs enough nutrients, it will gradually turn black and spray water down like rain.
After it rains like that, the color returns to pure white again.
It is widely used as medicine because it helps digestion and has pain killing effect.
That’s because a poisonous mushroom kills just one person.
Dice mushroom
It’s the size of a thumb, and comes in red, blue, or yellow. Small and cute.
A number between 1 and 6 will vividly appear in your mind if you eat it.
It’s an interesting mushroom that has a very strange effect of manipulating the human mind.
But it is normally used only in gambling games where each person calls out a higher number.
There was a time when I bet with a friend, and the number 6 didn't come out even after I ate 20.
Can't you just reject the number that comes to mind and say 6?
The effect is stronger than you think. You can't just lie.
I tried really hard to say 6.
It is a short and powerful epilogue.
Virgil, first of all, I'm not stupid.
Secondly, don’t compare me to a mushroom.
Stop reading
The dark purple book cover is slightly soft but sturdy. It says the author is Mara Smith.
Where should I look?
Should I deliver [em1]1 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "StarJuice_Yellow_Name"))][/em1], [em1]1 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "StarJuice_Silver_Name"))][/em1] and [em1]1 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "StarJuice_Pink_Name"))][/em1] to Diane?

Kyla, do you remember the fountain at the center of the village?
Of course. It was nice when we used to go there to sip on wine time to time at night.
Enite says she wants to fix the fountain.
That's a good idea. It needs some work, though.
Aren't you tired of building houses all the time?
No. I’d just be impatient if I stay still.
It’s also fun to see the village becoming nicer.
Me too.
Let’s see. Then the ingredients we have now... wouldn’t be enough.
I’ll work on the foundations. Can you get me some ingredients?
I’ll need 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Rock_Name"))], 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Mud_Name"))], and 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))].
Hand over the ingredients to Kyla?
I have some with me.
Hmm... That’s perfect.
Oh, come to think of it, little Rubrum had told me something.
Enite and Arden might be up to something.
I don’t know. Rubrum said Enite wouldn’t tell him even when he begged.
Anyway, they’re definitely getting ready for something. Maybe a party or something.
I wish I could just get hammered... but I guess that would be difficult with two little kids, hahaha.
I’m not a little kid.
Right. You’re a cool witch.
Hmm... A party... I wonder if I have anything to prepare.
Come to think of it, don’t you have something like this?
During the Harvest Festival, the witches would gather in Highlion Square and put something down.
At night, there were bursts of lights coming from there, and it was spectacular.
Uh... That sounds like...
A [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))][/em1].
Exactly! Why didn't I think of that?
Because crafting was prohibited at the School for Witches, but you’re an apprentice witch now.
If they allowed that, the School would have needed to be repaired at least 10 times.
It wouldn’t be that bad.
I don't know what I did, but I guess I was helpful. Hahaha.
Right. I came up with a really good idea.
Then do your best with the repairs, Kyla! I’m going to go now, something came up.
Okay. Okay. Let’s all cheer up.
If it’s a recipe, we could ask Diane about it, right?
Rubrum would love it.
Alright, I took notes. I'll bring it.
It will take about a day to repair the fountain.
Well... Like I said before, I can roughly remember, but I don't exactly know who it is.
Still, wasn’t there any kind of trace left?
I searched the inside of the store on my own after you left, but there's nothing in particular.
Hmmm.
Come to think of it, there are things I put outside because I'm going to throw them away.
At least take a look at them.
I’ll do some other work first and come back later.
Do what you want.
Why did you try to throw them away?
Because I've had them at some point but I didn't know why.
There are quite a few things that I’ve thrown away like that even in the past.
Some of them seem to have been taken by other people.
If you see something you like while looking, you can take it.
It might be cursed...
Never mind then.
You’re here.
Yeah! How was it, Arden?
Still the same. Even after eating that candy or something, I couldn't sleep because of the dream.
Hmm... Do you remember anything else about the curse?
Hello, Arden.
Arden?
<shake>Arden!!!</shake>
Oh! You scared me.
What made you sneak up on me and shout my name?
I’ve been calling for you countless times!
What were you so occupied with that you couldn’t even hear me call for you?
I was just dozing off.
Come to think of it, you do seem a bit tired.
I haven’t been getting much sleep lately.
There’s this night light I keep next to me when I sleep, but I lost it.
I went out at night with it one time, and I just completely forgot about it as I headed back home.
I went back to look for it after I remembered, but it was gone.
Did someone take it?
That, I don’t know.
Try looking for it here and there.
What does it look like?
Sorry, I’m a little busy right now.
Sure. You can find it whenever you’re free.
It’s a special silver color, and it doesn’t have a wick or candle, even though it’s a lamp.
I took it to the large lake, way out from the village.
Alright. I’ll look for it.
It wasn’t there when I went to look for it, but you never know.
That area is filled with the [em1]scent of flowers[/em1] at night.
I need ingredients to repair the fountain.
Should I give you the ingredients needed to repair the fountain?
Let me ask for 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Rock_Name"))], 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Mud_Name"))] and 10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))].
Reparing the fountain will take more than a day.
Are you done with your work, Ellie?
Let’s go right now!
Then I’ll go with Arden. Come to the front of the fountain with the others.
You can use the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))] at night.
Should I spend time with Enite until it nightfall?
I should make a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "FirecrackerPotion_Name"))].
Kyla said that it’ll take at least a day to repair the fountain.
Let’s talk to Enite tomorrow.
Enite! I heard you’re preparing something.
Oh my... I guess everyone in the village knows already.
But we don't know what it is.
And I’ve also prepared something.
I'm sure its something wonderful if you prepared it, Ellie.
Could you call the villagers?
You can do that later if you have some work left.
I’ll be back later.
There’s something I would like to do together.
Oh, you’re here. Can you help me?
Of course. What’s going on?
I had an idea, I want to add special [em1]decorations[/em1] to the house. I’m going to need more [em1]special materials[/em1].
Can you gather these [em1]materials[/em1] for me by [em1]today[/em1]?
Great, this is really motivating.
The only thing is I need these materials [em1]today[/em1].
It’s okay. Even just following the blueprint will make a beautiful house.
Do tell me if you change your mind.
Oh, did you change your mind?
I need to know before the house is complete.
Witch's potions are in high demand.
If you deliver [em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow, I’ll buy them all for [em1]40[/em1] Gold Coins. How does that sound? 
Okay. Let me know again if you want to.
Alright, it’ll still be available until tomorrow.
Today is [em1]the day to deliver potions[/em1].
Hurry up because the potions will have to be delivered by [em1]today[/em1].
Let's see here...
I think I’ll need a bunch of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow.
Please note that delivery is only possible tomorrow.
Because promises are important.
Give Aurea the potions?
You don't have enough potions.
I'll ask again later.
I've checked the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))]. Here's [em1]40 Gold Coins[/em1].
Today is the potion delivery deadline.
The scheduled delivery date is [em1]tomorrow[/em1].
[em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))][/em1]. Don’t forget.
[em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))][/em1].
If you deliver [em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow, I’ll buy them all for [em1]35[/em1] Gold Coins. How does that sound?
I think I’ll need a bunch of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow.
If you deliver [em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "ScratchCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow, I’ll buy them all for [em1]50[/em1] Gold Coins. How does that sound?
I think I’ll need a bunch of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "ScratchCandy_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow.
If you deliver [em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Candy_02_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow, I’ll buy them all for [em1]80[/em1] Gold Coins. How does that sound?
I think I’ll need a bunch of [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Candy_02_Name"))][/em1] tomorrow.

[em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1]. Don’t forget.
[em1]5 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))][/em1].

Peddler Visit Hours [em1]8:00 AM to 6:00 PM[/em1]
The round and lengthy one, right?
Uhh... It was more shriveled than lengthy.
Grandma said that means they're withered.
I heard it can grow again with good nutrition.
I can’t just wait for it to grow.
Check the [em1]Encyclopedia[/em1]. Also, don’t forget about the [em1]Witches’ Catalogue[/em1].
Oh, it's a notebook.
Might be useful later.
The prickly vines go all the way up there, but there is no path.
There has to be a way to get across. Get closer and take a look.
Did you see that? It grew instantly!
And you wonder why people look for witch potions.
I can step on that to get through now.
Let’s follow the prickly vine traces again.
As long as this one is fine like the one next to it, I think I can cross.
It’s withered, so find a way to [em1]make it grow[/em1].
If you really don’t know, it’s okay to ask others.
Hmm... [em1]A way to make it grow[/em1]...
<shake>Ah, I can’t take this anymore!</shake>
It’s too noisy.
Just hold on a little bit longer.
You’re fine because your ears are just flaps of leather!
To be fair, your ears are just leather too.
Ugh... Virgil. Don't say it like that.
Think of a way to get past that noisy Gaga Bird.
Hmm... What should we do?
<shake>[em1]Go away!!![/em1]</shake>
Great, no big deal.
That’s being a bit cruel to the Gaga Bird, no?
You mean, that thing is being cruel to me.
I missed the train because of that bird.
It's not like the bird made you miss the...
Let’s hurry and find the [em1]Prickly Vine Core[/em1].
What is this sound?
<shake>It’s too noisy!</shake>
I’m sure the Gaga Bird would make a sound like this if we hang it upside down.
Wait, that one isn’t hanging upside down, though.
The Gaga Bird is crazy...
Maybe for the bird, that’s upside down.
The [em1]prickly vine traces[/em1] continue to the [em1]forest[/em1] behind the Gaga Bird.
It’s a real Gaga Bird.
<shake>Do you think we can get through...?</shake>
We could, if we can endure through that [em1]terrible sound[/em1].

Are you going to the peak now?
Let's go
Alright, let's go now.
No, I still have stuff to do.
Wait, I forgot the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SunlightPotion_Name"))][/em1].
The Earth is round.
Molecule
Do you think I became a little smarter?
What does being smart mean?
The potion is definitely effective.
The ancient witch language is simple.
A bunch of [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))] and a cup of [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "SacredWater_Water_Name"))].
It is completed by boiling the juice from [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))] and the sacred water while stirring it clockwise over low heat.
It’s simpler than I thought.
Wait, there’s more writing.
Uh... It was made... because it was difficult to manage with [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))]...?
I guess the medicine is wearing off.
But I still read the important information.
I can’t read anymore.
But the sacred water...? Where can we get this?
You can normally get it from a place like shrines, but I think you have to buy it from Diane here.
Good, since we have [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))], let's make it right away once we get the sacred water.
Um, I don't know what kind of text this is.
You learned it at school. It’s the [em1]ancient witch language[/em1].
What do you think? Do you think you became a little smarter?
The Earth is flat.
If it is round, how do people below or next to it stand up?
That’s because the Earth is pulling the objects above it.
And the reason why such force appears is...
Don't be silly and read the note when it works.
Although I'm not sure if you really became smart...
Let’s find the note and read what it says.
Great! It’s registered in the catalog!
Hmm... So, you can collect them using a [em1]butterfly net[/em1].
I don’t have one right now.
Not much you can do now then.
But, I want to do it right now!
Getting to the witch’s house in Highlion is more important.
Hmph...
Let’s go back down now. There’s gotta be something else that's fun.
Let’s see...
Now, do you see why you can’t catch any right now?
Time
Location
Habit
Tool
Take another look.
I don't think I'll get a wink of sleep on the train.
I wonder if there's anywhere I can sleep for tonight.
What about the ground? The dirt and rocks should make for a nice bed.
That's not funny, Virgil.
Look, the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonButterfly_Name"))][/em1] we saw at the peak is here too.
You might as well collect some for study purposes.
You think I could just sneak up and grab it?
Let’s take a look at the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonButterfly_Name"))][/em1].
Let’s check information about [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonButterfly_Name"))][/em1] since they're registered in the [em1]catalog[/em1].
Let’s use the [em1]quill[/em1] to register [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonButterfly_Name"))][/em1] in the [em1]catalog[/em1].
Wait. Do you remember what Mr. Gravier said?
[em1]Draw it before you touch it![/em1]
Approach it and use the Quill to draw it in the Encyclopedia.
Death lives under the bed?
No, not that...
I can’t go out with the weights.
Wait, what’s wrong with this?
Looks like we need to dig the a broom grave for the 12th time...
That’s not it. The durability is just low.
I barely rode it too...
Well, what can you expect from a free gift.
I think there was a good workbench at the workplace. I can fix it there.
All I need is a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Branch_Name"))][/em1] or a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Mud_Name"))][/em1].
Hello, Diane.
Diane?
<shake>Diane!!!</shake>
Hello! This is the [em1]Witches’ Catalogue[/em1] that gives you the most inexpensive products at best prices!
This is Diane to bring you happiness... Oh, it’s you, Ellie. Welcome.
I’m sorry, that was unprofessional of me.
Did something happen?
Hmm... I’m not sure if it’s okay to tell you this, since we just met.
What is it? Maybe I can help.
Hmm. Ellie, do you remember the [em1]potion purchase service[/em1]?
The Witch Administration runs a [em1]program for buying back potions[/em1].
Please let us know at any time since we purchase regardless of the type.
Oh, that’s right. You mentioned you could earn some [em1]Luna Coins[/em1] this way.
And every [em1]day of the week[/em1], we buy potions at a [em1]higher price[/em1].
You can select one out of three in the list provided and deliver [em1]within 2 days[/em1].
But since we’re buying at a [em1]higher price[/em1], don’t lose this [em1]nice opportunity[/em1].
And there’s also the [em1]Special Potion Delivery Service[/em1]!
Then, I’ll explain again.
Ah, I remember.
Recently, there have been several reports of bad potions.
Trust in the Witches' Catalogue’s potion quality. Trust in the Administration!
As a result, the Administration issued a notice to each catalog sales person to test the suspicious potions.
The problem is, the witch’s houses I’m in charge of are related to the suspicious potions.
As you know Ellie, potion quality is also a matter of a witch’s confidence.
You can’t do it yourself, Diane?
I need a witch to accompany me with the test, for certification.
It’s a small reward, but I made some [em1]Nubicula Cupcakes[/em1].
[em1]Nubicula Cupcakes[/em1]!!! My mom would always buy one for me on a weekend if I’d been good for the week.
So naturally, I’ve hardly had any so far...
If it’s alright, may I ask for your help?
Alright, I’ll help!
Thank you. Please take this first.
And...
A bird cage?!
To start testing as soon as possible, I also caught a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FlowerBird_Name"))][/em1].
You can throw the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "NutritionPotion_Name"))][/em1] to the [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "FlowerBird_Name"))][/em1].
Then, I’ll record the details like the date, weather, time, wind direction, etcetera.
You’re very... serious about this.
Also, please let me know if you make a bad throw.
When the [em1]results[/em1] appear, please [em1]gather[/em1] them and take a look.
Hmm... It looks like there’s no more room in your bag, Ellie.
Please come back once you’ve organized your bag.
One... Two, Three... Four.
Four new flowers have bloomed!
Hmm... Moderate temperature, mild wind, and low humidity...
Great. Fortunately, the potions here seem normal.
It went well, right?
Yes. We can relax now, as at least one of them is normal.
This is the reward I promised you, [em1]Nubicula Cupcakes[/em1].
Hurray!
I requested this as a test this time, but [/em1]using potions to Collect[em1] will be much more convenient.
There is a saying that the Witch’s House, which supplies the most potions every year, uses just as much.
Again, thank you for your help.
Have a nice day, Ellie.
Tips about using Potions can be found in the [em1]Encyclopedia[/em1].
A [em1]letter[/em1]!
How nice of them to leave a letter behind.
Let's see... I think it's from the bartender on the train.
You're probably shocked to see that the train is gone.
A witch suddenly appeared in the middle of the night and got rid of the prickly vines.
They said they can't wait because the train was already delayed, so we had to leave.
But don't worry. The train will come back and there's a [em1]village[/em1] nearby where I used to live.
You can just spend some time there. There should be a [em1]sign[/em1] in the forest, so take a look and go find the [em1]village[/em1].
When you arrive at the [em1]village[/em1], please send Enite and Arden my regards.
"Bartender"
He said there's a [em1]<wave>village</wave>[/em1], Virgil!
Are you even a little upset that we missed the train, Ellie?
There's a [em1]village[/em1] nearby!
But I can't imagine where it would be. We explored the area quite a lot yesterday.
It was probably too dark to see. Let's look for it again.
See if there is a [em1]sign[/em1] as well.
How about [em1]cleaning[/em1] the witch's house?
We might have to stay there until we find the village.
Please try not to sound so excited. We missed the train, remember?
That place we saw earlier must be a [em1]village[/em1].
It's okay since there is a village, right?
I guess we can just wait there.
You never know what might happen...
You must get rid of the [em1]prickly vines[/em1] at the village entrance.
Also, try checking if a [em1]village[/em1] really exists.
It’s the bartender’s letter. Shall I read it again?
Read again.
Don’t read.
We can simply find the village.
And clean the witch's house.
You heard me, right?
Well then. I might as well add more to the Encyclopedia now.
It’s best to avoid that crazy bird.
Wait, is there such a [em1]potion[/em1]?
I really need to get through.
Hmm... Then, have some [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BeefStew_Name"))] in the meantime while I think.
Wow, that looks delicious.
[em1]30 Gold Coins[/em1].
You said you have to go through [lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "Gaga_Name"))], didn’t you?
Don’t eat
I don’t have money for the stew.
It’s difficult unless [em1]you can't hear at all[/em1].
Well, you are a [em1]witch[/em1] after all. I thought you would have come up with something before asking me.
Well, OK then.
That’s it?
This is [em1]Diane Greenwind[/em1] who brings happiness. Nice to meet you!
Yes, hello. I’m Ellie, an apprentice witch.
Yes, nice to meet you, Ellie!
What I must help you with today is... Oh, you’re [em1]registering[/em1] for the first time!
Just a minute... Okay, thank you for waiting.
So, I need to see the [em1]master witch[/em1] before registering. Is she inside?
The [em1]<shake>master witch</shake>[/em1]!?
Yes, I need the [em1]master witch’s signature[/em1] to register in the Witches’ Catalogue.
<shake>Oh, that’s... Um... I’m...</shake>
[em1]<shake>Hey Ellie!</shake>[/em1]
Eh? Huh?
Fooling around while I’m out? You didn’t forget to register with them?
<shake>Eh...Huh?</shake> Oh, no, I didn’t forget. Of course not.
Oh, I guess the master witch is at [em1]some place else[/em1] now.
Are you talking through [em1]that hat[/em1]?
<shake>Y...Yes!</shake>
Stay quiet, Ellie. You [em1]unfinished dumb hat[/em1] of a little rascal.
I told you to tell me when the Witches’ Catalogue employee comes!
I'm sorry, I was just about to tell you.
Oh... Sure. Then I guess Ellie can just [em1]sign[/em1] instead because the master witch is here!
You can just sign here and here.
Okay, just a minute...
Why can't you even do one thing properly?
M...
It must have been inconvenient for you to not be able to use the Witches' Catalogue.
Yes, that’s it. Then I’ll explain [em1]how to use the Witches’ Catalogue[/em1]. Would you like to hear it?
Listen to the explanation.
Do not listen.
Yes, please explain.
Every morning, a Witches’ Catalogue employee will come. In this case, it will be me.
I’m planning to be here from 8 am to 6 pm.
You can just purchase the items you need from me during that time.
We do not accept Gold Coins and only accept [em1]Luna Coins[/em1].
What is that thing called [em1]Luna Coin[/em1]?
[em1]Luna Coin[/em1] is the currency used in witch society.
I don't think I need to hear it.
Are you sure?
Ellie! You unstitched fur hat! You’re clueless about all this! Listen!
Listen right now!
All right! I’ll just listen!
Have a nice day. This has been Diane Greenwind of the Witches' Catalogue.
Do you think it went well?
Yes, it looks like the urgent fire is out.
How was my [em1]acting skill[/em1]?
You? I’m the one who did the acting. You were dumbfounded.
It was all an act, being dumbfounded.
This might become a problem later on.
No, not your poor acting skill but the fact that the [em1]master witch[/em1] is not here.
The [em1]master witch[/em1] must be at the witch's house. We can’t just have an apprentice witch.
Can't you just keep acting?
How long will it work?
And there's still the matter of the [em1]witch who was originally here[/em1] at this witch's house.
It would be nice if we know who that witch is.
Let’s ask the villagers later on.
The [em1]witch who was originally here[/em1]...
Could also be [em1]someone with malice[/em1].
It is called Luna Coin because it is made of an ore with the power of the moon...
Don’t you know already that since you were also raised in a witch society, Ellie?
I think I learned it in school... It's just that I don't think I called money something else in my life.
After all, only Luna Coins are used in the witch society. 
But how do I earn Luna Coins?
I guess you don’t have enough Luna Coins!
What...? Basically yes.
The Witch Administration is running a service to purchase potions to prepare for such incident!
So do you have any more questions?
No, not anymore.
Alright, then feel free to talk to me if you need anything.
You’ll also receive a [em1]gift[/em1] if you join now.
Woah! A [em1]gift[/em1]? What is it?
A [em1]Witch’s Broom[/em1] that's easy to use.
A [em1]Witch’s Broom[/em1]! Finally!
Yes, go ahead.
The gift...
Right, I’ll give it to you now.
Let’s deliver potions with the broom for now.
You need to get to Enite.
Oh, you’re right, but there’s no need for urgency.
Finally! My own broom!
Yes! I'm all done [em1]cleaning[/em1].
I think we're pretty well-equipped now.
We can make [em1]potions[/em1] now!
First, let's go find the location of the village!
We can't stay here forever.
Let's look for the [em1]sign[/em1].
There was [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1] in front of the village.
The [em1]Stubborn Weed Elimination Potion[/em1] should do it, right?
It’s a [em1]'[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BadGrassPotion_Name"))]'[/em1].
Alright, let’s do it.
Even though it's only half as good since it can't be processed...
It would be hard to make properly because the machine tools are broken.
Since there were ingredients on the ground, let's try making with them for now.
Whatever!
Check the recipe in the Encyclopedia.
You'll probably be able to make it with the ingredients you were lucky enough to find.
Let’s try making some with the stuff we picked up earlier!
What do you mean why? Why not?
I asked because people usually have reasons.
But, you should finish cleaning up before you leave.
It seems like something dropped on the floor.
Do I need to sweep the floor too?
Now I need to craft [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1].
Finished cleaning?
This is a potion ingredient, isn’t it?
You’ve used them in school countless of times.
Are witches usually this sloppy?
Sloppy or not, they’re careful with their ingredients.
Then I guess the witch that lived here was really sloppy.
Or she was in a hurry.
Beats me.
Enite! I got rid of the prickly vines!
I saw it. Indeed... You really did it.
Thanks to Enite and others for telling me about the prickly vine.
Still, you're the one who did it. Good job.
Now let’s call the people and also bring the village back to normal.
Okay, Ellie. I think I can do it with you.
Then, are you going to contact Kyla now?
Yes, I wrote the letter in advance.
I’ll give her the letter.
You would? Thank you. The peddler also happens to be at the village, so please hand it to her.
Okay. Oh, and can I send my letter as well?
Of course. Can I ask what you wrote?
I want to see you soon.
I'm waiting for you.
You’re always welcome.
I wrote that I want to see her soon.
I wrote that everyone is waiting.
I wrote that she’s always welcome.
Kyla would be happy too. Then, I’ll leave it to you.
Okay, don't worry.
The mailman doesn’t come anymore, but you could give it to the peddler instead.
It’s a shovel.
Let’s take the shovel first.
I guess he was making something.
But where did Rubrum go?
All little kids are like that.
At the mountains in the morning, river in the afternoon, and fields in the evening.
Would it be okay to not look for him?
Wouldn't that be unnecessary? He probably knows this forest better than you.
You can look for them if you’re worried about them getting caught in a spiderweb.
It’s here.
I don’t see the huge castle.
I guess it collapsed. Rubrum will be disappointed if he finds out.
Should I tell him to make it by putting water next time?
I mean it’s also easier to scoop up and collect water if you use the shovel.
There is no potion that can lift the curse now.
Shall I give her the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "UncurseCandy_Name"))]?
May the blessings of nature be with you...
Hello...?
Yes, hello.
Am I speaking [em1]properly[/em1] now?
Yes, I think so.
Wow, thank you so much. To hell with nature.
I could tell that the old man I met in the western jungle was suspicious just by looking at him.
I tried to speak backwards, write, but I could only praise nature. Pure torture.
I hope nature just rots and dies.
Still, I'm glad it the curse was easily removed.
Oh, thank you so much! My name is [em1]Aurea[/em1].
<shake>How long has it been since I said my name...</shake>
My name is Ellie. I'm an apprentice witch.
Oh, did you come to this town to be an apprentice?
I was on a train, but I got off for a moment and It left without me...
Oh dear...
I was about to enter the town, but it's blocked off by some prickly vines.
Damn nature.
Thankfully, we found an empty witch's house nearby, so I've been staying there.
An empty... Oh, yes there's a witch's house here. That's good.
I’ve business in the village too, but the vines stopped me. Nature be damned.
I'll be here for a while, so let me know if you need anything.
Yet I simply couldn't ignore such a well made wooden image of a monkey.
After I bought it, I could only talk about praising nature...
I guess it really was a curse.
Oh, then... Can I ask you a favor?
Not a favor, but a [em1]fair price[/em1].
What do you need?
The tools were broken when I was trying to use the Dispensary at the witch's house.
Do you have any tools or parts?
What kind of tools or parts do you need?
I need a glass bottle for the [em1]Extractor[/em1] and a [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RoasterHandle_Name"))] for winding the [em1]Roaster[/em1].
You'll probably be able to make it with the ingredients you picked up at the workplace earlier.
Wait a minute... I’ll look for them.
But Ellie, do you have any money?
I do. Mom gave me pocket money when I came out.
You think you'll be able to buy witch tools with just enough pocket money to buy a snack or two?
Eh, is that so?
What if I don’t have enough money?
Since you have tools, make and sell potions or something.
You can also sell candies now.
Only if there are people to buy them.
I found it.
Take this.
<shake>How much is this?</shake>
Oh, nevermind. This is return for breaking my curse.
Wow, thank God.
Unfortunately, I don't have any [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RoasterHandle_Name"))] for the Roaster.
I see...
Will you be staying at the village? If so, I'll bring it next time.
I'll sell it at a proper price then however.
Good, please bring it then.
Okay. I’ll write [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RoasterHandle_Name"))] in the memo.
Now we’ll be able to fix the Extractor.
But are you really going to stay in this village?
I should until the train comes.
I have no choice.
No, I mean, are you really going to leave when the train comes?
That...
I'll decide when that happens.
Let’s just fix the Extractor first.
Oh, and take this too.
Since the price for the bottle earlier wasn't enough. I'll give this to you as well.
Sure, come back next time.
I didn’t throw it properly.
Well, it happens.
I thought we’d need it, so I had one hidden!
Really? How?
Don’t ask how.
The atmosphere will become awkward.
Be careful this time.
Again, the atmosphere might become awkward.
Here it goes!
Alright. By the way, do you have the [em1]tea[/em1] Arden asked for?
Oh, right.
I'll bring it to him.
Oh, okay! Thanks!
I’ll get it to him safely.
Okay! Don’t forget to teach me how to breathe fire too!
[em1]<shake>I’m gonna breathe fire!</shake>[/em1]
Woah!!! Wow! How? How?
Arden said he’ll teach me.
Me too! Me too! Teach me too! I want to breathe fire too!
I’ll learn from Arden and teach you.
Okay! Promise you’ll teach me?
I forgot to give him the tea.
Diane, do you happen to sell an ingredient called [em1]sacred water[/em1]?
Yes, I have it. Should I have it registered in the catalogue if you need one?
Yes, please do that.
Alright, but it's [em1]a little[/em1] expensive. Is that okay?
<shake>How expensive...?</shake>
It costs 150 Luna Coins.
That’s too expensive!
I can’t help it because it’s a precious ingredient.
Can you... sell on credit...?
Selling on credit is kinda...
I really need that ingredient now. Would it be possible?
Hm...
I will definitely pay you back... The master witch will also stand surety.
[em1]Surety[/em1] is not possible but [em1]guarantee[/em1] is possible.
Just a minute. Let me think about it.
<shake>Would she do it...?</shake>
At times like this, third-class people refuse.
Second-class just accepts.
Then what about the first-class?
They would promise to give something bigger.
Although they would also take that much...
That’s kinda scary...
I’ve made the decision.
I’ll give you the sacred water [em1]on credit[/em1].
...?
She’s second-class.
Doesn’t first-class usually come out here?
I don’t know what you’re talking about...
So, are you really giving it to me on credit?
Yes, I usually don’t, but Ellie is my valued customer.
This time, I will specially give it to you on credit.
Instead, I will give you on the surety of Ellie and the master witch here.
‘I mean guarantee.'
... Please keep my trust as much as I’m giving it to you by trusting your guarantee.
Of course! I’ll be sure to pay back. Don’t worry.
Alright, got it! Thank you for your business.
Ellie, I hope you haven't forgotten.
For [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))], you need [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))][/em1].
There's no way we can find a phoenix around here.
We have a [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))][/em1] right here.
You told me all about it earlier.
Oh, Ellie... That's not a good idea.
If we do that, we might not be able to get back on the [em1]train.[/em1]
We might not make it to [em1]Highlion[/em1].
That again?
You just like it here better.
You just don't like the witch's house in Highlion.
That's true.
Stop being childish. You're going to regret it later.
No, Virgil.
What I will regret is not doing this right now. I'm sure of it.
You have to be smart about this...
Ugh.
Great! I have all the ingredients now.
Ellie, you’re worse than Aria sometimes.
Oh, please. I'm nowhere near as good as my mother.
That wasn't a compliment.
Alright, now let’s make [em1]'[lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))]'[/em1].
Aurea, do you also sell food ingredients?
Usually only for the requested items? Do you need something?
Oh, I got this from Arden, but...
He said he bought this pepper from you and there was something strange about it.
Hmm? No way. Shall we take a look?
Hmm... This is red pepper. It’s a pepper with a mild sweetness that is proud of the unique flavor.
I gave it to Arden to try it out, but I guess he didn't listen again.
Well... Arden thinks this pepper is cursed.
What? That’s nonsense.
I’m very sensitive to curses.
A curse makes me shudder. I would never sell something like that.
Right. I also thought it was weird.
I have my pride as a merchant.
I never play with what people eat.
The weird thing about the pepper is that it's just a different kind.
I think Arden was just mistaken.
Hmm, but there are cases where a curse is hidden. Shall we look into it a little more?
What was it again? The thing that tasted terrible.
Curse Detection Candy?
It's not really a memory I'd like to recall, but...
I should ask Diane if I can get a recipe.
Wait, I forgot [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Arden'sBag_Name"))][/em1].
This is a dragon, right...?
It looks a lot different from Arden, though.
Maybe it's Arden’s appearance in the past?
Ahhh!
What’s this?! A curse?!
The neck has been separated.
Now the terrible curse...
That’s not it! Something’s inside.
Drawing? A person? What a terrible drawing. 
And strange letters are written on it. Is this also a painting?
It’s a dragon language. The dragon scripts.
You know, Virgil.
This isn't a curse.
Arden just forgot someone.
Apron, teacup, wine glass, and dragon sculpture...
Oh, can you read it?
That I don’t know.
He’s dreaming because he threw away a bunch of stuff. Since he can't remember...
Because he’s a dragon?
Because he’s a dragon that lives many lives.
Let's take it to Arden.
The spilled bottle, scribbled paper and a book... What a mess.
Just brush off the dust.
Just brushing off the dust might take a lifetime...
[em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "MoonOil_Name"))][/em1]? Looks like a [em1]recipe[/em1] for potion.
I guess it was used by the witch who was here.
It reads, "a potion with the [em1]power of moon[/em1]". The ingredients are [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Encyclopedia", "MoonFlower_Name"))][/em1] and [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "Phoenix_Collect_Name"))][/em1].
Only very expensive materials are used.
I’ll use it someday. Let's have it ready for now.
There is also something underneath.
Where? Oh, you're right!
You mean I learnt how to read these strange symbols?
Your score wasn’t bad either.
It seems like [em1]moon’s...[/em1] something...
I have no idea. I got a headache.
Take a look if you remember later.
Um... Looks like a [em1]recipe[/em1]...
Shall we take a look anyway?
Yeah! I should put it away and revisit it later.
This desk would be nice to use as a workbench later.
There’s no use for it now.
Arden, are you sleeping well?
I'm here.
Huh? What is that?
The smell... Is it pepper?
Why are you giving me pepper all of a sudden?
Don't you find it strange?
Uh... It’s just pepper.
Wrong. If you look at it, you can see that it's mixed with a strange colored pepper.
After hearing what you said, it does look a little dark red in color...
I keep having dreams that I don’t even remember.
I even sleep with a night light by my side but it’s useless.
The only new thing in the restaurant is this pepper, and it has a strange color but a subtle, sweet taste.
I’m sure this pepper is cursed.
A curse on pepper...?
There is nothing strange about it, since there’s even a curse that makes you just praise nature.
If you’re a witch, you’d also be familiar with curses.
Can you find out what the curse is and lift it?
I think the that will take some time and I'm a little busy right now.
Is that so? Alright then.
Where did you get the pepper?
I bought it from a green-haired lady who often comes to the village.
Aurea?
Exactly. I smelled a strange curse from that lady last time.
I'm guessing she touched something strange somewhere.
I'll try to find out.
I think I should be able to hang the weight on the hook. Should I do it?
It looks like a hook that you can hang something on.
Did it work? Did something happen?
Hmmm, alright. Let's go to the place where the garden door was.
Enite! I got you something that’ll light the streetlamp.
Oh, what’s this?
It’s [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1].
It’s a potion that makes your body glow, but it’ll light up the streetlamp a bit if I put some inside.
Wait just a second, dearie.
Oh, it’s such a pretty pink color!
I made it to match your favorite color, Enite.
(Which [em1]Twinkle-Twinkle Juice[/em1] should I give Enite?)
Yellow Twinkle-Twinkle Juice
Pink Twinkle-Twinkle Juice
Silver Twinkle-Twinkle Juice
(Let’s think this over)
The light is a bit weak, but it’ll be useful until the Firekeeper comes back.
(I should come back at night to see it glow.)
Is it night?
You’ve picked such a pretty color. 
Through all my years, I’ve always thought this village to be beautiful...
...but it's simply dazzling today. Thank you.
Now Arden won't be burning any more boxes, right?
That's right. Thanks to you, we'll be safe at night until the Firekeeper comes back.
You went though a great deal of trouble for us.
(Do I give the Twinkle-Twinkle Juice to Enite?)
How goes lighting the streetlamp, Ellie?
Don’t overwork yourself now. Your health should be your top priority.
Looks like [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("InteractableObject", "LittleHoneyPumkin"))][/em1].
It's a type of weed that grows in forested areas.
The vines grow so fast that you can never get rid of the by hand.
You must find the [em1]nucleus[/em1] hidden somewhere to get rid of it.
Then I guess we can also get rid of this if we find the nucleus.
Or just return to the train quietly.
That can’t happen.
Let's go look for the nucleus. It must be nearby.
Since the nucleus gives off [em1]light[/em1] when you touch the vine, you’ll be able to find it.
It’s a hill.
It won’t be easy to climb.
Look over there. There are vines hanging on the hill.
I’ll be able to climb that much.
That’s bad news.
Welcome, long time no see.
It hasn't been that long either.
Is that so? Perhaps because been a while since I've been here.
Did you remove them? The prickly vines?
Yes, it’s nothing special.
Is that so? You’re humble.
But you did really well.
This village has been really gloomy for the past few years.
I'm just getting started.
That's a big start, because the hope that was gradually disappearing started to come to life.
So, never give up on this village.
Okay, don’t worry. I’ll never give it up no matter what happens.
You sound reliable.
By the way, did you happen to bring the thing you promised last time?
Are you talking about yacon melon?
No!
You promised the [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "RoasterHandle_Name"))] to use for the roaster.
I’m kidding. Of course I brought it.
But since this guy broke his leg...
I don’t think I can bring proper products for a while.
Oh really? I feel sorry for him.
Thank you for your concern. But don't worry. It will get better soon.
The things on sale would be trivial things. Instead, I have a good offer for each other. Do you want to hear it?
Sure, what is it?
As you can see, since Wisteria is not an environment to bring good products...
I'll make it better soon!
Yeah, but I didn't mean it that way.
However, there is a good witch here. I want to use the witch to our advantage.
Is there such a witch here?
That’s what I’m saying. I can’t see even from up here.
I'm pretty confident with my eyes whether it might be a person or a thing.
So Ellie, I want to leave the work to you. What do you think?
Naturally, you will also receive proper wages, since good things deserve good prices.
Really? For me?
Really? For her?
Yeah. I think I’ll ask for [em1]potion[/em1] or [em1]animal and plant gathering[/em1] here.
Of course I like it!
Naturally, I’ll also look at the quality of products properly.
That’s because good things deserve good prices.
Listen carefully, Ellie. It means a bad price for bad products.
Just like the talking hat said. Therefore...
It's Virgil. A hat that deserves a bad price.
Keep up the good work, Ellie and Virgil.
Okay, we’ll work hard.
Then, can I talk about work right away?
Since I’m not a witch, I will only sell the [em1]candies[/em1] that can be used by non-witches.
Since I basically buy them all the time, come and buy them anytime.
And you do need a lot of potions from time to time.
 Can you make [em1]10 [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "HealingCandy_Name"))][/em1] in just one day?
That’s kinda hard.
Isn’t it? I also have to talk to the person who buys it.
If I need that many potions, I’ll tell you [em1]one day in advance[/em1].
In this case, I’ll be able to buy it for more expensive price than usual.
Wow, that’s nice.
Instead, you must deliver after making a [em1]promise[/em1].
That’s because [em1]trust[/em1] is important.
If you think you can't because of other things, just say you can't.
So can I ask for one right away?
I thought about it yesterday.
But I'm still not sure.
The villagers...!
I don't know why you're more confident than me when I lived my whole life in this village.
Even so, I decided to believe in that [em1]happy thought[/em1].
If you [em1]get rid of the prickly vines[/em1], I’ll try to [em1]contact[/em1] the resident who was living in that house.
But if that resident refuses...
Don't worry because it won't happen.
Ellie, you are so nice.
Everything will be fine. Do not worry.
Yeah... Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, you mean they would want to come back, right?
The house at the [em1]upper left[/em1] side from the central fountain of the village belongs to [em1]Kyla[/em1], who is a carpenter.
That would be better. If you get rid of the prickly vines, I'll try to contact Kyla.
Okay, I'll leave it to you. You're doing me a favor.
So who should we get first?
Was there a [em1]carpenter[/em1] in the village by any chance?
Because I think the first thing we need is a [em1]carpenter[/em1] in order to fix the house.
Then it would be better to remove the prickly vines from [em1]Kyla’s[/em1] house first.
Hello, Ellie. DId you sleep well?
Alright, let’s get this started.
Keep in mind that we don’t have [em1]information[/em1], nor do we have a [em1]phoenix[/em1].
The first thing to do is to [em1]collect information[/em1].
Let’s look around [em1]Kyla’s house[/em1] once and collect [em1]information[/em1].
Let’s think about the phoenix later.
Would that be okay?
We're here.
Wow... A witch's house...
I have a favor to ask today.
Huh? What is it? Tell me.
Can you give this letter to Kyla?
Although I usually don’t do it for free...
I'll think of it as payment for getting rid of the prickly vines.
I guess I’ll see Kyla again after a long time.
Where’s Kyla now?
I think Kyla always wanted to come back.
Last I heard, she was helping out at the old smithy she used to work at.
I hope she comes back soon.
I'll give her the letter as soon as possible. The earliest she will arrive is tomorrow.
Yes, I’ll be waiting.
Wait, I forgot [em1][lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "KylaLetter_Name"))][/em1].
Are you delivering it to build Roy’s house?
Right now, this is what's needed.
You’ve gathered everything already? That was fast.
Take your time.
Alright, I’ll start working on it tomorrow.
If you have the time, drop by when I’m building. I have something to ask you.
It smells really good.
I’m drooling...
It's been a long time since I last had this.
I missed this smell.
Sweet things make my mouth feel gross, but this is delicious. Hahaha.
Maybe Enite just has the magic touch?
A giant pie! A giant pie!
Thank you, Enite!
Did everyone get a slice?
Have lots, everyone. Eat well, be well!
It’s time to wrap up today so we're ready for tomorrow.
I would like to thank everyone again.
Especially Ellie. It's been happy times only since you came.
You’re the lucky charm of this village.
I really like Ellie, too!
If it wasn’t for Ellie, I wouldn’t have returned.
Thank you for helping me return.
Great work, Ellie.
Let’s all keep doing our best!
So, you found the time to look for it?
There’s something I need in that bag.
Bring it back to me if you find it.
Sure thing, let me know when you’re available.
Give Arden the bag?
I haven’t gone out of the village lately...
So, I must’ve lost it here in the village.
Still, I can finally make [lua(GetLocalizedString("Item", "BeefBread_Name"))] again.
Come find me if you get hungry.
I’ve thought about it, but I have no idea who put the curse.
I think there were some cursed treasures as well.
Where are these treasures?
I don’t know. Must be somewhere else since we can’t see them.
If it was treasure, I think someone probably took it already...
Even if it is cursed.
Because you can’t tell from the outside.
Should I give the dragon figure and drawing to Arden?
Arden! Take a look at this! 
It’s me.
It really was what Arden looked like!
Wasn't that what you expected?
Still, I was surprised... No, that’s not the important thing.
Arden, take a look at this as well! This came out of the dragon figure.
My love.
It is written that way as a predicate.
Arden.
The reason why you keep dreaming is not because of a curse, Arden.
There is someone Arden has forgotten.
So maybe, that's the reason why you keep dreaming about that person?
I said let’s run a restaurant together.
With who?
A warrior who was after my treasure.
Yeah, I loved this warrior. That’s how it was.
Where did this person go?
Died...A long time ago.
You don’t need to make that face because I don't feel anything.
Thanks. I think you’re right.
Don’t know why she popped up in my dreams, but I’ll know once I dream again.
Hmmm, I did it, right?
Yeah, thanks.
It's still too early to thank me! I’ll also help you find your other memories, Arden!
That wouldn’t be necessary if I can sleep but... Do what you want.
Anyway, thanks for your effort.
But, is this thing called love this desolate?
That depends on the person.
Still something... seemed more emotionless than when I read a book.
If you forget that you even loved, doesn’t that mean you never loved much?
No no.
He said he keeps having dreams...maybe he forgot something he didn’t want to?
If Arden is even forgetting his feelings, I want to help find them for him.
Because you’re a witch?
Because of your unyielding spirit?
Because you feel sorry for him?
Yes. Helping others is the witch spirit!
Of course. Ellie the witch accomplishes what she has started till the end!
Yes, it would be very sad if he forgot the person he loved so much like that.
Arden, I found it.
Oh, where was it?
Rubrum found it first, but he forgot to bring it back to you.
But how’d you end up taking a night light all the way to the lake?
Just ‘cause.
Again with that “just ‘cause”
I’ve always visited the lake from time to time for no specific reason, is all.
The urge just comes up sometimes.
And when it does, I go and gaze out on the lake for a while.
A fond memory, perhaps?
Who can say...just a habit of sorts.
In any case, thanks for finding it. Here, have this.
I am a bit tired, but it’s not urgent.
Return the night light to Arden?
I found it near the Bitter Grape Tea Tree.
The house really looks amazing.
It feels like I’m back home.
Though I haven’t even lived here for long.
As long as you like it here, you can think of this place as your home village.
Haha, I’ll do that if I’m born again.
Also, check out the second floor terrace. I used the design you chose.
After all, the rectangular door is stable and I like it. 
After all, I think the overall harmony of the arched door is great.
A round door is fun because it feels like I'm making a secret base.
It’s a little... too much, but I like it because it’s cute.
I’m glad you like it.
It’s because you chose well. Thanks.
That’s because Kyla made it well.
Let me know if you need any help. I’ll be glad to help.
Oh, I just remembered that I forgot your shovel, what happened to it?
Rubrum brought it.
He said he forgot while building a sand castle.
Oh, that’s a relief.
Thank you for your concern in many ways.
There was an extra shovel in the luggage.
It's a pity that I have to send you back empty-handed though.
Oh, don't worry. It's something that I also wanted to do.
Hmm. What should I do?... Oh yeah, have you been to Arden’s restaurant?
Arden’s meat dumplings with a drink are awesome.
Uh... I can't drink yet.
Oh, Ellie said she looks just like her age.
I need to clean up my house and equipment for a few days. Could you come back in a day or two?
I’ll treat you to a pot of dumplings or something.
A pot... How generous.
I can also expand the [em1]storage compartment[/em1], so let me know anytime.
Could you get the tea I asked for from Rubrum?
I asked Rubrum to brew me some tea. Could you do me a favor and get it for me?
Give Arden the tea?
You should be able to get it from Rubrum.
I wasn’t sure myself, so I thought it through to teach you.
What's the big deal about breathing out fire?
Give Arden the Curse Lifting Candy?
Candy?
I can't sleep all the time, and I think it's because of this new pepper.
The color is reddish and it has a subtle, sweet taste..
I've never been unable to sleep well when there's a night light.
It must be some kind of curse.
Yes, it’s Curse Lifting Candy.
I asked you to remove the pepper's curse.
I checked with Aurea and also tried using Curse Detection Candy, but there was no curse in the pepper.
They say the reason for such color and taste of pepper is because it’s red pepper.
But still, regardless if its cursed or not, the candy is delicious.
That’s why I brought it.
Heh...
Unless we solve the main problem, this is only a temporary solution.
Anyway, witches get drunk on their feelings and butt in with this and that saying it’s a good deed...
And they only help out properly for a few times but it's merely for self-satisfaction.
Isn’t the reason you aren't able to sleep because you just say cruel things?
I worked hard in my own way because I wanted to help you, Arden.
Does it make you happy to talk like that?
I don’t think it’s the problem with night light or peppers. Arden, aren’t you the one who is cursed?
If you know what I do, can you find out what the curse is?
Do you know the meaning of the saying that dragons live multiple lives?
Oh, you cruel belly clock.
Would you like a bowl of Beef Stew?
I’ll also tell you what that means.
This is not because I'm hungry.
I’m about to listen to what Arden says since I’m broad-minded.
Said the belly clock.
<shake>Gurgle, gurgle</shake>
